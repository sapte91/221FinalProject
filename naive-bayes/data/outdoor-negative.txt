$80 for this?  Seriously overpriced.  If you can find something cheaper buy it, this is not worth 80 bucks.  Clamps were not capable of holding a small boneless ham without slipping.  Worked well with ribs

This seems like a great idea - the food is held in a basket, so that you don't have to shove a skewer through the meat. However, the little bolts that hold down the clamp onto the rack are meant to be tightened by hand. If you have a sizable chicken, you cannot tighten these enough by hand. I had the chicken fall out of the rack into the flames more than once. Then you have to tighten them with pliers, but the metal is so soft that you can only do this 2 or 3 times, and then the threads are stripped and the whole thing is useless! Again: hand tighten = chicken falls out; tighten with pliers = threads are stripped. Now I have to try to get replacement parts for the rotisserie from Weber. Good luck

For me, the LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock is of little value.  I talked with a friend living in Colorado who is very satisfied with an equivalent clock, but I am in New York and much further away from the transmitter and it just doesn't work to my satisfaction.  When it was first put on the wall in the kitchen and didn't work for several days, I contacted technical support.  They suggested I put the clock in a window.  I followed their suggestion and after 2 days the clock was set correctly.  I moved it back to the kitchen wall and now 7 days after the change to daylight savings it's still on eastern standard time.  I didn't purchase this clock to hang in my window.  I need a clock in the kitchen.  As soon as I can find a suitable replacement this one is going into the garbage where it belongs

The third time I used this brush it broke.  The wood split diagonally at the neck of the brush, a little  before where the bristles start.  I now have the perfect implement with which to stake a vampire.  My other Weber brush (which I purchased at a diff. website) is still intact and works okay.  You see the bristles are a little gunked up -that's why I bought this second grill brush.  -Buyers, and Vampires, beware

This seemed like a pretty slick idea, and was a pretty clock.  All it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs aren't lying, that it really is near lunch.  
I set it near our front (glass) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on.  So I hung it in our office (no window).  Two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night.  Apparently that can interfere with the signal.  Rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal, this thing was off by an odd amount of time, like an hour and 27 min by the next morning.  

I set it manually, and today it's off again by about an hour.  

The instructions to reset which I got from Tech Support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery, and what it's expiration should be.  

Man, that's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true.  For $25, and the packaging being gone, this is in the dumpster.  I'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month....but takes a month to show the error

The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck

    I was very disapointed with the smoker cover.  It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material.  This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching.  Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it.  The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable.      Sincerely yours,  Allen Vest III

Don't waste your money (even just 10 bucks).  The plastic is not rip-stop and tears very easily.  I will now just use a big, heavy duty, black trash can liner - they are much stronger

I normally BBQ 8-9 racks of ribs at once, for our annual party.  Thought that this Weber rib rack would make it easier.  However, I found that it was more of a hinderance than a help.  I like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce, several times, so I have to remove them from the rack for basting.  Getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain.  If you're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook, then it might be useful.  But, that's not me, so I gave my Weber Rib Rack to my brother-in-law.

Outdoor clock?

This seemed like a pretty slick idea, and was a pretty clock.  All it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs aren't lying, that it really is near lunch.  
I set it near our front (glass) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on.  So I hung it in our office (no window).  Two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night.  Apparently that can interfere with the signal.  Rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal, this thing was off by an odd amount of time, like an hour and 27 min by the next morning.  

I set it manually, and today it's off again by about an hour.  

The instructions to reset which I got from Tech Support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery, and what it's expiration should be.  

Man, that's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true.  For $25, and the packaging being gone, this is in the dumpster.  I'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month....but takes a month to show the error

The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck

    I was very disapointed with the smoker cover.  It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material.  This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching.  Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it.  The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable.      Sincerely yours,  Allen Vest III

I normally BBQ 8-9 racks of ribs at once, for our annual party.  Thought that this Weber rib rack would make it easier.  However, I found that it was more of a hinderance than a help.  I like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce, several times, so I have to remove them from the rack for basting.  Getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain.  If you're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook, then it might be useful.  But, that's not me, so I gave my Weber Rib Rack to my brother-in-law.

I purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now I am shopping for a different brand.  It worked fine for the first summer season in Texas, but now that it is spring almost summer--it does not turn on at all.  I have completed all of the manual's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it.  But, it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage!  I do not recommend!!

After twice sending the unit back to the factory, the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on.  I tried all the suggestions made by the factory.  The following year I opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong.  I found totally frozen fan bearings.  I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings.  To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump.  The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable.  When it worked, it worked well.  I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito

Essentially a one-season, lightweight, hibachi that doesn't stand up to extended use.

So, at $12 it's too expensive but may be worth about $5

A handle was missing - the box was retaped - may be a return from a store, etc.
Overall, the item is chintzy - you have to assemble it.
The charcoal pan is painted black - this will burn off slowly.
I am going to assemble it, but this item, when shipping is included, is a total ripoff.

Sometimes it doesn't pay to start your holiday shopping early. I bought this in October as a Christmas present. When my husband took it out of the box on Christmas morning, it already had a rip in the seam. I couldn't exchange it through amazon (see return policy) so I tried to get an exchange through Char-Broil. Their website was having problems so I couldn't resolve the issue online. I was on hold for 96 minutes after calling their 1-800 number. The lady was nice, but unfortunately she didn't know if she could help and had to send the request "to the top." I'm still waiting to hear back. It could be a perfectly fine grill cover, but I may never know

While the clock works quite well and resets as it should, the wireless outdoor thermometer is way off. I base this on two other wireless brands I own,an Acu-rite and a Oregon Scientific, along with the local NOAA weather broadcast, also WFIE TV. The Acu-rite temp=18.2 F, the Oregon Scientific+18.5 F,
and the NOAA broadcast temp @ 20:09 Jan28/07 = 18F, Local TV station WFIE-TV=18F.  [...]

As I write this, The Weather Channel also reports it is 18 degrees F at 20:30.

    The La Crosse WS-8256U-AL reports it is 23.5 F, more than 5 degrees off. In my opinion,a clock/thermometer costing this much should be dead on.
 Buy it for the time, NOT the temperature

I loved the idea of the electric heating. The "ease" of temperature control, etc... but the heating element melted. The plastic part of it did anyway... right where it conects to the metal bent "rod" that creates the heat to burn the wood chips.

It also was a pain to constantly snug the wood chips (even tried the chunk type woods) against the heating element. Which ment I had to balance the housing, the water bowl, etc. just to get where the heating element was at.

I don't know about other electric smokers, but this on "stank".

Just get one with a smoker box on the side... toss in some coals, wood... whatever... as needed. Don't try to make the unit too "scientific"

I have had this smoker since August and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it. I noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless. 

The other problem I have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed.

Dealing with Charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless.

At the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered I would pass for something better

I loved this smoker the first two times I used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it didn't work at all.  After examining all the parts, I noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points.  It was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but I was forced to pay the shipping!  I used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use.  I think I'll go back to my charcoal grill

After experiencing the same thing that many on here have witnessed (after 8 hours the smoker didn't get hot enough, and I had to finish my meat in the oven), I decided to ask Char-broil support on their website what I can do to remedy the situation.  

Their answer, and I quote, "Thank you for your response. To purchase replacement parts, please contact Grill Lover's at 1-800-241-8981 24 hours a day 7 days a week to place an order. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know."

WHAT??  They expect you to purchase a replacement part in order for their POS smoker to actually work??  What's a warranty worth??  BEWARE - this thing is worthless without some modification or purchasing expensive spare parts

This is a beautiful piece of B-B-Q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone, but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and I'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times!  Looking back at the original information, it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects. I wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect. I will let you know what happens. Too bad about the brush. It looked so good with my stainless steel weber...

I've had an old Weber for 15 years - still works well! However, as it was getting too small for my growing needs and starting to show its age, I "upgraded" to this model.
The new one has more bells and whistles - I do love the smoking burner/box combo. The rest of the features are nice too. However, this thing is almost impossible to get to 500 degrees to sear a steak or do some other high-temp cooking! It runs through a tank of propane in just a couple of serious days of cooking and once you're at less than 3/4 tank, don't bother with high heat - it's not there! 
On the other hand - very few flare-ups and mid/low temp cooking is great

I ordered this piece and the matching chairs.  I have waited since July for them to be available.  They became availabe in September, so I ordered them.  They kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs - said they couldn't get them.  So I  had to cancel the sofa as well. Now I am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue!!

Don't let the size of the box fool you.    Even though this item comes packaged in a good-sized box, this product is barely one inch by two inches.  It's just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it.    Although it does seem to attract flies for a few days, it doesn't seem to last for very long at all.   It's just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic!  In my opinion, it's just not worth it

After opening the weather station and setting it up, I noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing "characters".  I contacted Amazon and returned it.  Within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem.  When I contacted them again, they would not replace it again, saying that the "batch" they have must be defective.  I was not aware that Amazon was selling the "seconds" from other retailers.  A phone call to LaCrosse remedied the situation.  They advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace/repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises.  They further advised the "fail ratio" with the problem I had with both units is less than 1%.  Beware if buying this from Amazon

I guess I must have had the same mindset as Adam in the previous review.  I too set up the main unit and the remote side by side to see if the readings from both units would agree, along with another very accurate digital thermometer.  After six hours, the temperature readings from all of the units were within one degree, but the humidity readings from the remote unit were lower by 4 to 8 percent as compared the humidity reading from the main unit... which is 3 to 7 percent too much IMO since they were side by side.  What good is having a relative humidity function if you cannot trust the readings?  I will return the unit.

Also, on my unit, the front wood bezel apparently had a small defect and it was repaired (from the factory) with a wood filler type material... but the defect was still obvious

I purchased this item a few weeks ago to mainly kill fly's. It seemed that this wasn't happening as there were fly's still around and no evidence of fly's being killed. At night there would be a lot of flying bugs getting zapped though the noise would make you jump every time. It scared my Labrador Retriever to the extent she would not go outside after dark. The final straw happened when a young squirrel laid dead underneath it with no marks on it at all, I could only figure that it had got zapped. I finally switched it off and hung-up some zip lock bags with water inside, now there are no fly's and no interference with the ecology of our garden

I bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month. One night I saw a mouse running across my stove so I brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop. Later that evening I was washing dishes, and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of Shake'n'Bake RIGHT PAST THE RODENT REPELLANT FIVE TIMES!!

The repeller works fine at repelling, but when on the "rodent" setting it makes an audible chirping noise that's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people don't normally go.

The reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed, but the manual says that it'll only run two or three days on battery power, making it absolutely worthless for this use

I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.

Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere)

When I first got this home, it seemed to do the trick ok. The mice really avoided it, however we could still hear them across the room. I was going to order a couple more to place around the room, but they walk right past it now! It doesn't seem to affect them at all! For $20 it's not a bad deal because obviously it works for some people, it just didn't work for us:

Misunderstood directions, made mistake of putting all sides together instead of a level at a time.Cracked all sides trying to take apart. Called 800 # and asked what they could do for me and they said Buy another one, they're not responsible. Also found out the box had two right side upper levels and it will take 7 days till the left side is sent. Suncast will never get my business again and I hope my warning will discourage others from doing business with this company

I bought one of these summer 2005. This unit runs way too hot to use as a smoker (easily 250-300 degrees F). I even got a replacement regulator from the mfctr, but both ran too hot. I've had some success controlling temperature with valve on LP tank and a C clamp on the gas hose, but only limited luck. I've tried using an electric hot plate burner, but that only worked in warm weather and barely got above 200 degrees. Hate to say it, but would recommend you invest your money elsewhere.

I was disappointed with these tongs, which was surprising since OXO makes good kitchen utensils.  I agree with other reviewers, it is difficult to grasp and close them.  Unless you have a rather large hand (which I don't), you're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel!  When comparing these to my 12" tongs my hand grasp was at the same point - which really made these 16" tongs no different from the 12" ones.

aside from the nifty weather prediction, this clock is completely impractical.  The projection numbers are about 1/2 inch tall with minimal clarity.  The clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible.  I am surprise this is sold on Amazon.  Thank goodness for Amazon's customer friendly returning policy.  I think Amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good.

The good news is that it mostly works--although the weather forecast is, as advertised, only about 75% accurate.  Unfortunately, it has some annoying flaws.
1) Although it will provide either 12 or 24 hr format and either Celsius or Fahrenheit temps, you can't actually select the temperature display--once you select 24-hr time format, you get Celsius temps whether you want them or not.  If you want deg F, you must select 12-hr time.
2) If you run the clock off batteries, you have to press a button to get any projection.  Unfortunately the button you press is the snooze button, which activates both the projection and the backlight; the button to control brightness of projection does not work in battery mode; activating both lights simulaneously is both redundant and wasteful, as it runs down the batteries more rapidly than necessary.
3) Worst of all, the device emits a very annoying, very audible, high-pitched whining sound any time any button is pressed (including the snooze) and anytime you need to set or reset anything.
4) Manual confusing; information on website did not tell me anything I needed to know.  Emailed support--no acknowledgement, & although I eventually got a response it wasn't remotely helpful, and I had already given up on them and returned the device

This product is a waste of money. The mice in my room are completely unaffected, and walk right by the device without any sign of concern. Besides being ineffective, the devices themselves make a slight buzzing sound (not silent as advertised). I now have to buy a set of (humane) mousetraps, and I recommend that anyone reading this do the same and save themselves $40

My smoker arrived dented and chipped, which I wasn't happy about but I could live with -- I don't expect a relatively inexpensive outdoor oven to maintain its new look after some wear and tear anyways.  However, the rails along the sides that hold the shelves are not welded together well.  In fact, two rails arrived completely broken off (opposite sides and at different levels) and a third was tenuously held in place by a single weld.  I thought that the broken-off rails were parts to be used in the oven's assembly; otherwise, I would not have unboxed the smoker and put it together.  I would have returned it. 

Because I had assembled the unit before realizing that it was broken, I thought that replacing the broken parts would be easier than disassembling the unit, re-crating and returning it.  I called the distributor three weeks ago to order replacement parts that have not yet arrived.  I've already waited longer than the distributor indicated I would have to before receiving the parts.


If alternative gas-fueled smokers didn't cost a multiple of what this costs, I'd be really angry.

Hands down, this is the most unsatisfactory purchase I've made from Amazon.

In spite of the impairment of not having a fully functioning smoker, I have seasoned it and used it once.  The chicken I made was promising. (My hope that my experience with this smoker will improve lets me award a rating of 2 stars based on this one use.) If I ever get the parts I need, I think the smoker will be adequate for initial experimentation with this kind of cooking.  If I like the results, I'll replace this smoker with a better one

I ordered The Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker in anticipation of a summer of barbecue.  Unfortunately, the unit arrived structurally damaged.  Based on the state of the box, I would say it occured prior to UPS picking it up, but have no way of knowing.  Sadly, the replacement unit was also damaged.  There were huge dents that broke the welded seal.  I gave up, have requested a refund from Amazon, and will seek a different brand of smoker.  I would definitely advise not to buy this product

In theory this is a nice set, and I like all of the different tools -- but I bought this as a gift, and I'm going to return it.  It just looks too cheap.  The wooden handles are chipped in some places, there's almost no finish on them, and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking.  Perhaps if I was buying them for myself I wouldn't mind, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift

I live in a apt in nyc, so roaches are very common problem. After a long battle I finally got rid of the roaches in my place, but I cannot escape the bugs visiting from other apartments. I thought this device could help with that problem. Also, I don't like to use the spray too often or have all the baits, gels, and other poisons around, so I decided to try these things. Unfortunately, they don't work. The first week I bought them I saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room. The ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it. Instead of this repeller I use Limonel (orange peel oil) is a safe alternative to use when children are present, and it does repell and kill the bugs.
So, how to get rid of roaches? Seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam, wood sealer, etc. Mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents, so I put mosquito screens to block their way in, also I sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and I bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor. Also, my husband sprays once every 4 months with repellent. Good luck

I bought these things because I really hate silverfish in my apartment. Before I used them I only found silverfish in my bathroom. At first I put a big one (for large room) in the living room and one week later I found a silverfish on the wall just 1 foot distance from this repeller. After that I got two for medium room and I put one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom.  Several weeks later I found one silverfish in my bedroom (near the repeller) then I thought these things might be pest attractors. So I unplugged the one in my bedroom and put it in the kitchen. But I still found silverfish in my bedroom and bathroom, and living room, but no one in the kitchen until now. Hmm, now I think these stupid things are just night lights.

As the title says, the remote sensor died a quick death so I got a replacement unit. The remote sensor died on that one pretty quickly as well.

I know that sometimes things go wrong with good products, but two sensors dying so quickly apparently was not a fluke. This is a cheaply made piece of equipment, so I guess you get what you pay for.

I gave a friend an Oregon Scientific unit three years ago and it is still going strong, so I'd advise you to stay away from La Crosse and go with Oregon Scientific

It arrived fast enough, but I should have sent the chair back. It's pretty cheaply made, the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape. It's OK, but I'll keep my eyes open for a better one. And we won't swing on it. I don't think it would take it.

No way chair could be converted to 7 foot hammock as advertised. I should have read advertisement closer. I could have gotten 100% cotten chair for less. This ad didn't state the material used.
I could buy from this company again I'll just pay closer attention

We got this for our deck last May and it started to rust almost immediately. I took it down in August to store for the winter. Tried to assemble it today (mid April) and two parts fell apart in my hands. Save your money

Looks nice when it was standing. Took several hours to erect doing it by myself. Had 20 mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and I had to throw it all out. Wrote to the company because it was only 2 weeks after I received it, and heard nothing back. So, if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy. But if not say goodbye

Mine showed up broken.  

It seems that a single "string" on a pulley is what is used to raise and lower the umbrella via the crank.  The string in mine was broken off (not connected) and inside the main pole.  Not a great design for lasting a long time in any kind of weather.

I'll try another brand

I'm very unhappy with these lights. I placed them along the planter in my patio a couple feet away from the fence in full sun, but they didn't work at all.

We set them out in the middle of the patio, and now five of them do work for a little while, but they don't accomplish their purpose in that area. They're also in the way. One of them has never worked at all.

I gave them the old college try for a month or so, but now it's too late to return them, so I'm stuck with them and out my money

After buying two automatic retractable Hozelock 50 foot hoses (that we love) I bought this for the extra hose length.  It is a very disappointing unit.  It tends to bounce around when you are pulling out the hose and can be a pain reeling it back up.   I am a big guy and still struggle with it.  Pull the nozzle back to the unit as instructed and then sit on it as you crank.

Regarding the comments about it only taking the original nozzle I cut off the end and put on a std US hose fitting

When my house painter couldn't figure out how to use the nozzle, he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts.  I looked everywhere on-line for a replacement part, but could not find anything.  Finally, I called Hozelock in New York and they sent me a replacement part.  They charged me about $6 for shipping a part that cost about $3.  The system can't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler.  Also, it is hard to reel the hose in.  Overall, I don't think this item is worth the cost.  If you need to call Hozelock their number is 1-800-297-7461

Bought the Driveway Patrol and had nothing but problems with it.  It constantly went off, no matter how many times I moved it around.  Also, when a car drove INTO the driveway sometimes it wouldn't go off!!!  Talked to the Telebrands people and after having to pay shipping to send the first one back, they replaced it free.  However, it worked just as bad as the first one.  NOW they refuse to refund my money!!  This product is an absolute ripoff and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.  I agree with the other review that they would give it a minus 10 stars!!  I suggest you beware of any other products you might want from Telebrands.

Worked OK for about a day and a half, then it would go off every few minutes for no reason. Changed batteries several times, to no avail. Changed position in case squirrels or cats triggered it. Moved it from place to place, even watched the scene, and still sounded the alarm for no reason. This is a piece of junk that will drive your dog crazy. !!! AVOID !!

Outdoor remote temperature sensor is not weatherproof.  Instructions state "The remote temperature sensor should be placed in a dry, shaded area."  The battery cover has slits in it that will allow water to enter the unit.

Do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill! There were warnings with this product saying that it shouldn't be left outside, but I figured it couldn't be that bad. A couple months later, I discovered that my cutting board (left on a covered porch through a mild California winter) had completely split into several pieces. For a $30 outdoor product, this is really unacceptable. A plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better

The chair has good back support and fits a 6 ft tall man well with even a little extra wood to support the head.

My stool arrived with the wood split so check it before the driver takes off if you can.

Mind the instructions when you are putting it together.  If you don't watch the bolts and the small blurry print on the step by step notes you can get turned around.

Also, the wood is almost orange in it's color

These lights don't hold a charge.  I called the manufacturer and they said that these are "summer/spring" lights that require 12 hours of direct sunlight to work.  The ad on Amazon did not say that.  I even charged the batteries using a wall charger and they still barely held a charge (1 - 2 hours).  They are also very dim lights.  Don't waste your money

It does not like rapid changes in temperature.  When the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back.  
All of that is moot, because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors, though it is a mere 45 degrees outside.
Sent it back

I like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature: the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature.  

Ok, so I have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside/outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more.  Many mornings I check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read, for example, 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees.  It will be 60 degrees inside. 

My window is double-paned, but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings.  

When not window-mounted and placed by other thermometers, the readings are acceptable and consistent

This basket is NOT stainless steel as advertised.  It is merely chrome plated.  I returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault'.  Amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers.  I believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault.  This is not the level of customer service I have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with Amazon

I also ordered this based on the description of "stainless steel" and was disappointed to receive a chrome-plated product. Worse yet, it doesn't even fit the Char-Broil Universal Rotisserie attachment I have for my grill.

The installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool.  Once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter.  I have not found a station with one yet.  You can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke.  They dont sell the black tool and it's designed so nothing else fits.  You have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool.  Another $17.00 down the drain. After my third one, I finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle.

Well, the Hansen Gas-Mate II Quick Disconnect Adapter will temporarily solve your BBQ connection issues, but ONLY TEMPORARILY.  What will inevitably happen to you will be suffering my fate.  Upon emptying your tank, you are going to find someday that you will have this adapter stuck in the threads of the tank.  There is no place to grab the adapter with a wrench or pliers to get a good grip on it to turn it.

Save that little plastic inner piece that comes with it as you can get an adjustable wrench around the square outside of that to turn the adapter out for a while, until the day comes when the torque required is too much for the plastic inner piece.  I would also recommend greasing up both sets of threads, the ones on the new tank and the ones on the Hansen Gas-Mate II adapter.  AND DON'T OVERTIGHTEN IT putting it into your new full tank.

This adapter is another bad design by Weber.  This adapter should come with either a strong metal inner piece that helps you remove it, or it should have some portion of the adapter itself on its outside that operates like a nut and serves as a grabbing point for a wrench

This grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine.  Not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear-able, the drawstring at it's base is very easily prone to breaking.  

I have bought and had to return this product twice already.  Save yourself the trouble and look up market for something that you can depend on for a little longer than a single use

There oughta be a law. 

I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.

Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere)

Look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while.  I say it's flimsy because it's so skinny.  Other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you're stabbing into cuts of meat.  This smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more.  I say just get the larger one that's more stable and takes less effort

I bought this grill basket for my husband for Father's Day.  According to the description, it had everything we were looking for: detachable handle, separate sections for separate cooking, grilled veggies won't fall through, etc.  Unfortunately, the basket is so poorly made that the baskets don't open (without a crowbar!) and the handle neither attaches or detatches without a whole lot of muscle.  My husband had to get out his tools and try to rebend the whole thing to get it to function.  What an over-priced dissappointment

The spit is a very thick steel bar that is difficult to bend. The forks and clamps to hold the food are solid with thick chrome. The motor is made in Taiwan and my first one came in dead on arrival. Read up on the other Weber Rotisseries reviewed by other customers and you will see the motor is a weak point

This metal detector is nice, notwithstanding, it performs poorly when in all metal mode.  Initially all metal mode works fine, however, after half an hour of use the batteries begin to wear out and the battery low indicator does not come on.  When all metal mode is used after half an hour of the detector's use, it just squeals uncontrollably.  It's supposed to go off over metal and pin point the source of your initial find with great accuracy.  Again, after thirty minutes of use of the detector, it will no longer go off over the source, it will just go off constantly, no mater where you hold it.  I could hold it into the air and it still squeals.  I made every adjustment I could and it just continues to make noise.  This mode is worthless unless your using it with two fresh 9 volt batteries every half an hour.  Finally, if you're hunting say meteorites for four hours, you can expect to spend over $56.00 on batteries for that afternoon

I grill year round and in many weather conditions.  Unlike the gold and platinum grills, the silver grill does not have a carry handle to keep it shut for transport (see the review about the burnt down car), nor does it have the ability to prop the lid as a wind/rain shield.  The silver grill works fine in nice weather for fast, hot cooking, but if you want to grill in a drizzle or in a little wind, the ability to prop the lid up (available on the gold and platinum models) is essential.  I lost my gold grill.  Last night I tried cooking in a little rain on the silver grill, and it wasn't up to task like my gold grill was.  I'm going to buy a gold or platinum grill this time

I spent the extra on this alarm because I wanted a projection feature.

The projection feature lasted 2 weeks.

I also had a wall clock made by LaCrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity.

Save your money, folks.

Hopefully, Amazon will refund my $$

The clock works well,but is really too small,and the projection only works well in dimly lit locations. It also has to be at some optimal distance from the wall to actually see the numbers.It does not have a focus feature if you wanted to put it close to a wall

I regret this purchase. This clock has a very, very low projection beam that barely makes it to my ceiling from my bedside table. It's definitely not readable if you have diminished eyesight and aren't wearing glasses, as is the case with better models.

Even more troubling, the atomic clock part seems to set itself to random times in the middle of the night.

On the positive side, the temperature reads accurate and it's nice to have both inside and outside temps in a cheaper model

This item came to me and as much as I tried, the only way I could view the numerals on the ceiling was to see them upside down. There was no way to turn the unit so that it would project so that I could read it from my bed. I tried placing it on both sides of the bed but that didn't work either. It seemed to me, the guts of the unit were placed in wrong. And there is only one way to move the projector. So, I cannot recommend this item.  I sent it back

Yes the pot held the oil and turkey and the fire lit under the pot. It didn't fall down under it's own weight and fried my turkey. That said here are some problems. I had to make 3 trips to the hardware store so if you purchase this item and read this first, you should knock that down to ONE trip. But you will make the trip none-the-less. First off the three scews that hold the legs on are listed at 2" but are more like 1 1/4" and thus had to be replaced ( or you WON'T get the nut on the screw ). Second, and this is crucial, the main bolt that goes through the burner assembly, burner holding bar, and heat shield is made of "Made in China" crap metal. It will already be installed and is sticking out of the burner assembly. In the instructions you have to remove it's nut and washers. But when reapplying the nut and washers through the bar and heat shield, it WILL strip unless you get lucky and tighten it just right the first time. This bolt needs to be made of good steel... and it's not!  If it's tight just let it be because you will strip it if you mess with it. It is impossible to find if you need to replace it because both hardware stores I went to didn't have it and didn't know where else to find it. It is a 6mm 2 3/4" bolt. My solution to fix the stripped bolt was to add 3 washers before screwing on the nut and thus catching on some fresh unstripped thread. Luckily there was enough bolt showing. Had that not worked this thing would have been junk just 1 day before Thanksgiving and I'd have been rushing off to buy a differant one.
Just look over your parts before assembling this thing and make sure those bolts are as long as they're supposed to be and if not make that one trip to the store for bolts and washers too. I guess whatever model/brand you get will be made in China too (isn't everthing?) so I don't want to recommend another, besides I've only owned this one. Make sure you follow ALL precautions about using this thing to the letter. I would also add that even a little wind will slow down or stop your cooking time as the burner blasts out the gas so fast (which is normal for that hot a flame needed) that the fire is only on the tips of the gas so find a relatively wind free place, errect/effect/find a windblocker/lean-to but DEFINATELY outside and away from structures or anything that can fall and knock over your pot. Gobble Gobble!
By the way the turkey was soooo good that everyone raved about it and wanted to take (did take) it all home. Look around for tips on preparing, injecting and rubbing the bird. I kept the temp at 350 (initially at 375 but after you SLOWLY... slowly dip in the bird the temp will go down) and then maintain 350 from there out. Get a bird at 15lbs or under (or the pot will fill too high)  and cook for 3 1/2 min. per pound. Look for more tips online. That bird was tastey

I purchased 8 of the AA batteries because of the low price of 4.99 for 4.

The fine print on the battery indicates 1900 milliamps plus or minus 10 percent, so the range would be 1710 to 2090 milliamps. After many days of "refreshing" the battery in my La Crosse BC-900 charger I ended up with the following: 

1634 Milli amps
1795
1701 
2001
1769
1781
1754
1549

So two of the cells are below spec.

Earlier I had purchase some 2700 milliamp batteries from Sanyo, on Amazon, for about 12.99 per four. All of them were within spec.

I'm glad I didn't pay a penny more than 4.99 for four.

Of 12 batteries I purchased, 2 of them were leaking in the box. I would rate these higher except that I also purchased 20 AAAs and 12 of them were leaky. I imagine I was just lucky that only 2 of this size leaked. Take the fact that most of these batteries will be bad when you compare prices. I paid $4.99/4-pack which is a good price as long as more than half of them survive (whick may not be very likely)

I had an "EZ-UP" 10x10' shelter in my back yard, and when one crossbar broke, it broke 2 others. If anyone had been sitting in the chair in my back yard, they'd have become a shishcabob from the cheap thin metal used to make these canopies. Although EZ-UP sells products on their web site to facilitate holding these canopies down in the wind, they do NOT cover ANY "wind or rain damage," and although this, in my view, was NOT a factor of why the frame failed, the company's first response when I called to get a return authorization after it failed only after about 8 months of use, they quickly stated "we don't cover wind or rain damage, cut me off, and had apparently NO reguard for anyone's safety, stating that if it was raining or even in the slightest wind (I think it failed in around 2 mph "winds"), their "warantee" did not cover it! They said I could send it in and THEY would determine (after paying an outrageous sum of money to send it back) IF they might replace it, but that they likely would not. The people at the company were rude, had NO concern that their product had some safety issues, and so I'm looking to buy something less expensive, and that lasts longer! INteresting, they told me that they don't cover ANY wond or rain "damage", yet they also sell hold-downs & it states on their web site (& apparently in directions that I never received with mine) NOT to fold it up if it was wet, but to leave it up!

I had a MUCH less expensive shade that latested MUCH longer and I'd recommend others to do the same, or to buy an industrial model that CLEARLY stated in their warantee that the product can withstand wind up to "x" mph & that it is made to withstand rain as well. 

After my experience with this company's product, and their staff in the returns dept., I would avoid ever buying one of these again! I received mine as a gift (that cost my friend over $200!)

There are MUCH better, sturdier, and safer canopies out there. 

If I could give this product a zero or negative score, I would!

These canopies are NOT NEARLY as sturdy as I recall them being years ago (or perhaps that was another brand?) 

I expect these canopies will be recalled in time due to safety issues.

I would STRONGLY recommend buying something less expensive and sturdier

  The grill is up to Webers usual high standards but I do have a couple of quibbles with it.  I bought the Q grill because I needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv.  Since every pound counts, the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel.  But an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface.  I don't have the time nor inclination to "season" a cast iron grill.  What I would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface

a year ago we bought a performance series and was very happy with it until a week ago when upon lighting it the fire spread out of the pit area and melted the controls.  Char broil was unconcerned and indicated that did not sell replacement parts.  No comments whatsoever on the safety.  It seems that replaceing the grill on a yearly basis is expected at Charbroil.  In the past we have used Weber and got ten years from the grill.  I would look at the Weber

This seemed like a wonderful grill, but the regulator (which keeps gas from leaking) failed after about a month.  Unlike other grills, the Charbroil regulator has to be purchased as part of the full burner assembly (over $100, while other grill manufacturers sell just the regulator and tube, for about $20).  The regulator's not covered by their warranty, either.  Customer support has been terrible, with "communication" only coming through Charbroil's FAQ's on the Web.  Fortunately, there are enough other Charbroil owners with similar problems who have written on the Web about this problem.  I will never buy a Charbroil product again.  This has all been so terribly disappointing, because I've wanted to support a good U.S. company -- but Charbroil's engineering and customer support is reminding me of the big three automakers in the 1980s.

Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest.  First, I was expecting something that would assemble "in minutes"... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into "minutes".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts.  Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner.  Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar.  Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill.  There are many better systems available out there than this.  Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end.  I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal

I purchased this product in May 2006. However, it is not working this year April 2007. I replaced the 40 watt bulb, but it still does not work. This is not a product worth the expense. I would say that for less that 11 months of use $8.00 would be a high enough price to pay

I recently bought the Stinger UV15. It worked well for one month! In that month I followed the recommendations for cleaning it and keeping it clear of dead bugs. Well just shy one month and the grid has completely failed so it attracts the bugs, but doesn't kill them. This product is not worth the money

I purchased a 40 wt Stinger Insect Killer from Home Depot last year and the bulb started shorting out after 3 months. Since it was near the end of the season I decided to store it and replace the bulb when I put it out in the spring. The bulb was replaced but would only work intermitently. Insects also clogged it after a couple of days. I gave up on it and recently  purchased a Flowtron BK 40 and it works great Don't waste your money, buy a Flowtron instead (my last Flowtron lasted over 20 years with the same bulb).

I have bought and returned 1/2 and 1 acre Stinger bug zappers from Costco 4 times now in the past 3 years. Thank God I was buying from Costco as Stinger products are worthless. Light attracts them but zappers don't work. Some worked for a week and others didn't zap at all. I don't know why Costco carries such a terrible product. I kept thinking, maybe these were a bad batch and I will finally get a good product. Not so, do not buy these products

I purchased one and it lasted about 3 months; light still worked but did not kill any bugs attracted to it.  Stinger replaced it under warranty-this time it lasted one month-same problem.  Stinger replaced it again under warranty and the third one lasted 1 1/2 months, again same problem.  
Will not go to the trouble to get it replaced again-will buy a Flowtron which I had used 5 or 6 years ago and which lasted for 2-3 years.

On my second one now...Not that I liked it much the first time, just that it is the only brand they sell in the local store here.  I will say that while it worked, it worked...I mean, it killed some bugs!  These, however, are my problems with it:  Bulbs burn out fast!  Like after four to six months...And the replacement bulbs are almost as much as I paid for the whole unit!  The thing gets jammed up with bugs and there is no easy way to clean it.  Finally, it doesn't appear to be very weatherproof.  The first one died after a storm and the one I have now has just died.  I think I am buying a different brand on here...One that works for more than a few months

I bought one of the custom tile #7's (loaded with options) from California and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self-destruct. I tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years, until they skipped to Mexico. Tiles just didn't fall off, they spalted. The fire box broke, etc. When it got too bad to use and look at, we had to throw it away . . . a $1500 mistake.

If there was a really good ceramic cooker out there, I would try it again. They cook like a dream

I am the owner of a kamado, purchased in August of 2000 when the company wan located in Sacramento, CA. After owning the unit for less than two years, I started to develop cracks in the interior of the kamado. the company would not replace or honor the life time warranty on the unit. Since that time the tiles have come loose in sheets and I have a defective unit that is unsightly and not what I purchased with the supposed lifetime warranty. All calls and emails to the company would not resolve the defects in materials and workmanship. The company's answer is to glue the tiles back on the unit. This is not acceptable for a unit of this cost. Check and see if you unit is made from ceramic materials or from Portland cement as in the case of mine. unless kamado has changed their manufacturing process in Ensenada, Mexico the units are made of Portland cement. This material will not last and carries no lifetime warranty. I am sorry to give them one star, they don't have a negative star number. check out this company with San Diego BBB and Sacramento BBB and read before you buy. There are various website that deal with the
fraud of the kamado group. Their website does not allow any truthful posts. The truthful posts are removed almost immediately.
As they say on eBay, BUYER BEWARE, FRAUD, AND NOT WHAT THEY REPRESENT.
There are true ceramic cookers out there for sale, that are truly ceramic and not ceramic coated tiles in grout.

I have one other Weather Station from La Crosse that seems to work ok, but this thing is a paperweight as far as I am concerned. It shows that it is raining out when the sun is out! It constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off. I have attempted to contact La Crosse, but as other reviewers have said, that is a lost cause. They never answer any emails regarding product help or issues, and no one seems to answer their phone either. Maybe I have a lemon, but I feel for what they charge for their products, La Crosse should be more responsive to their customers

I am extreamly disappointed with this product. The icons do not give an indication of the type of weather you can expect. Instead, they provide an indication if the weather is getting worse or better. The fluff on the out side of the box states: "Forecast Icon Based on Changing Barometric Pressure." The way I read that is the Icons will provide a forecast, but they do not.  I do not understand why you would have a rain Icon, a cloudy icon, a partly cloudy icon and a sunny icon if they are not a forecast. I was so surprised at reading this in the manual, I called La Crosses tech support. Tech support confirmed what I read was accurate. As stated, in on of the other reviews, the station is difficult to read when it is stand mounted. You will have to bendover or be in a seated position in order to see things clearly. Adjusting the contrast does not help. Wall mounting might be a better option. The buttons, as stated in another review, feel mushy when pushed. The outdoor sensor is not compleatly weather proof so you will need to mount it where it will not get wet from rain or snow. A potentially great product that is poorly executed.

The clock was off by -4 hours even after so called rebooting. I called tech support and they requested me to send the clock back to them at my cost so that they can pop the hands off and advance it four hours. They should have replaced it for free but they did not. I just think this clock is just a big hoax

I have owned the WMR-968 for several years now and have spent more on 'replacement' parts than if I had bought an entire new unit.  Primarily, the solar transmitter on the rain gauge continually fails to bring the charge up to enough power for the transmitter to transmit back to the base.  I have replaced this transmitter unit three times (twice with the 'new' style).  Living in the Phoenix area, we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days, but as soon as it doesn't get sunlight for any length of time, the display reads all dashes (not receiving a signal).  So when it rains here, I usually don't get a reading of how much because this thing stops working.  The anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole.  The anemometer works consistently and fine.  Both OS and the local distributor say the distance is too far, the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement, etc.,etc.  Replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other.  No one can help with this issue.  So my suggestion would be to spend the extra bucks and get something more reliable.

One star is the lowest rating I can give this system and it's frankly not worth even that. Problems start with the design. You have to take out eight tiny little screws to insert the backup batteries or plug in a sensor cable into the nifty looking "solar powered" sender unit, which has to be placed somewhere in full sunlight for it to function at all. Once you've mounted the unit on your roof, you have to remove those pesky little screws on the roof, in the freezing wind usually, several times a winter. Or wait for Spring and nice weather when you don't need to know if you can expect black ice on your early morning drive to work. 
Sometimes resetting the base station works (which you have to place inconveniently so that the unit has direct line of sight communication. Usually not. OS Sales has it advertised at 300 feet, but actually something less than forty if your batteries are more than a day old (see battery change procedure above). By the way, there is a backup nicad battery in the unit, supposedly kept charged by the impressive solar power collector. This will fail because it rapidly loses capacity due to a poor discharge recharge cycle. If any of these three fail, the unit won't function. 
Strangely enough, my rain gauge (I live in the desert) has continued to function for over a year with little attention. However, the temp/humidity sensor which I would like to refer to most often, is what fails every night. I'd like to replace the Nicad battery, but can't find one anywhere. 
Ahem. Customer Service and the lack of it. I don't know how many emails I've sent. Or calls I've placed. Or time I've spent listening to the backside of the Oregon Scientific hold button. Their website only lists complete systems in the replacement parts category. While assumptions can be dangerous, my only option seems to be to scrap $300 worth of two-year old hardware and buy more, and more, and more. 
This was a well-intended gift. I'm trying to make it work. but it doesn't, usually when I need it most.

I bought the WMR968 2/10/2005 and as of today,2/14/2007, only the indoor Baro-Therm-hygro still works. The Anemometer was replaced under warrenty 11/2005. This service took 2 months to complete with Oregon Sci. The anemometer then quit 12/2006 and Oregon Sci. said tough luck it's out of warranty. The Thermo-Hygro quit 2/2007 and once again, tough luck.

 My thoughts on the unit besides it not functioning after 2 years: Cheap and cheaper. The manual is nearly worthless. The anemometer is accurate to about 60 Kts. then gets wildly optimistic. The temp.,humidity, baro seem accurate. The rain gauge is kinda funky the way it reports because of a delay built in and the resolution but it is useable. All of the failures I have had I think are related to water intrusion into the sending units. Everone has had green corrosion on the PC boards when taken down from the rooftop. The sealing of the units is very poor and the use of phone cords is very cheap. 

 I just got off the phone, again, with Oregon Sci. and Juan from customer Service told me "we can't help you". 

 If you want a weather station that is made cheaply, has no customer support and will last less then 2 years buy a WMR968. I guess for the price compared to professional weather stations this thing will attarct a lot of people but buyer beware

We have had this weather station for a year now an more times then not there are absolutely no readings!  I only get an indoor reading, which I could get from my thermostat!  We have reset it, messed with the sensors, moved it around the house in many locations with a direct site on the outdoor sensors and still no readings.  Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings.  This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband!  Also I called customer service and was on hold for over a hour and still never got a human to talk to for help!  Don't buy this product!!

The spring on these tongs broke on first use, in September, 2006.  This renders them largely useless. I purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired.  Despite this assurance, I am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective.  I returned them, and I cannot recommend these tongs

We took a chance on these for part of a Father's Day gift and the piece of metal that acts as a spring broke after only 1 use. After reading the reviews I called the company instead of returning for a refund. They were very nice and sent out another one. This one just broke - exactly like the other one - after about a month of use. The overall design of the tongs is great like other Raichlen products but the construction is severely lacking. Don't waste your money on this model.

I spent several months and 5 purchases trying to find a good set of tongs for my husband who is the pickiest "BBQ Expert"...These were one of the WORST. DO NOT BUY THEM. The locking mechanism is clunky. They do not open and close smoothly. The OXO 16 inch Tongs are much better and lighter. You do want tongs that have a hinge vs the ones that are permanently open waiting for you to squeeze them around what you are trying to pick up. Good luck. I had to send these back

I bought this unit becuase it says it measures 11'8" square.  Well it actually measures 9'8" square.  So, now I have to take it down box it up and start again

I bought this clock expecting it to: show the humidity in a room; show the temperature; and to set itself for daylight savings.

It does neither of the above. The temperature stays at 60 and the humidity measure it always WAY off. In the same room I have an alarm clock that does all of the above accurately. 

The clock is attractive and easy to read and it keeps time ok. But it should do more. 

I am very disappointed

I purchased this particular clock because it was described as an "Outdoor" clock.  Upon receipt of the clock I read the instruction book and under the section entitled "Frequently Asked Questions" is the following: 
"Q. Can a La Cross Technology clock be used outdoors?  
 A. Yes, but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 F andd 131 F.  This clock is NOT water-resistant."  
Living in New England, we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 F.  The clock has a VERY misleading description

I bought this product no long ago.  It never works.  Mice still jump around, and even make noise.  I call the company.  They don't have technical report.  The product manual says, once mice get used to the ultrasound, it will not work.  I never heard about this from other company.  This company is very bad.

Okay here is my indepth review. 

I have little flies of some sort in my Hydroponic vegie greenhouse. I bought this seemingly easy little hunk of plastic to make a sound that's only bothersome little animalsand bugs hear. 

4 days after purchase the little guys seem to be flying to the ultrasound. The jig and bop back and forth like they are dancing....I bet they are dancing, making love and reproducing to the Ultrasonic waves! 

I killed more bugs inhaling while plugging this in my Green house. 

Rather then take it back I suggest you huck it at a Black & Decker Exec as the are robbing us telling us this thing works. On the box they site a study but don't show it's reference. When I called BD they said, "We don't know what study that info came from". They are hornswaggling us! This is gonna be big like Enron! Corporate Karma! 

Update- 7 days later. I really wanted to give this product a chance as I'm lazy beyond belief and plugging stuff in is right up my alley. If I have to go buy Lady bugs or pest spray I'm gonna be pissed. 
SOOOOOooooooo I bought 4 more and plugged them all in for 3 more days in my small greenhouse...... not a damn thing happened. Actually I think it works like a rave and extascy for the flies. There are more of them now and they seem to be having much more fun!

So in conclusion, This thing sucks more then the suckiest thing that ever sucked a suck. Only buy it if you need some extra plastic hanging from your outlets.

I bought this unit and used it one time in a smoker and everything worked perfectly. The next time I went to use it I found that the probe had failed. Replaced batteries and then checked probe with an ohmmeter and found it was open circuit. So it cost me $20 to cook one meal. My advice is to look elsewhere if you need a digital thermometer

I purchased two cushions to use on small chairs.  When the cushions I arrived, I could hardly believe how small they were, smaller than the description stated.  In addition to the small size, the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions.

The name on this item should be "pillow". It is much too small for a cushion. They need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head. I wish I had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before I ordered it. Lesson learned

These outdoor window thermometers SEEMED like a good idea,  however, they're worthless!  The LCD display is NOT bright like shown in the picture.  The numbers are so light they are totally unreadable.  Also, the suction cups will NOT stay stuck to a cold window.  I'm returning them

Not the manufacturer's fault, I blame U.S. Congress for this....

The clock has an internal chip which did not recognize the earlier DST change this year.  There was going to be such a long delay before being able to get a replacement chip and/or clock that we just returned the clocks.  Disappointed

I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'.

My biggest complaint was that I was missing four of the pieces and had other extra pieces when I received it.  I got bounced back and forth between Amazon and Suncast's customer service before I got the right people at Suncast to send me replacement parts (which took over a week to arrive).  On top of that, they didn't even send me the right replacement parts!  After another phone call and explanation, more parts were sent.  If I keep the extras I have, and make a couple more calls, I may have enought for a second shed.  Ugh.

Directions are ok, but they'll make you scratch your head as you look through all the similiar looking parts. Especially when they don't send you the right pieces

This product was purchased as a Christmas gift and unfortunately did not work as advertised.  The projection light only was operational when touched - perhaps this was defective.  I have returned the product for a refund and am awaiting the refund.

The unit is supposed to have a projection LED. The manual states that "When the unit is plugged into AC outlet, the projection alarm will continuously project the time."  This does not happen. What good is the projection when in the middle of the night you have to find the clock, find the right button and read the time befor the light goes out?  How do you trust a company like this

I bought this thing to solve a problem and I have a new  one, I red the little manual, trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way. It does not stay in projection mode, if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button. I change the battery, I left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters  and no way. I wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection. Of course I do not recogmend it.

The product promises good results, but the instruction manual is very unfriendly and confusing -- and printed in such small fonts that one needs a magnifying glass to read it and a third hand to execute the steps that are indicated.  Unfortunately, as an average customer, I have only two hands.
After several attempts, I still have not been able to make the display light up permanently onto the ceiling.
I look forward to resolving that, but the problem is that you need a combination of obscurity in the room to view the display on the ceiling, but light on the instruction manual to read it

I bought a new grill and wanted to make sure it was used properly. I don't like it when small pieces of food fall through, especially on gas grills, so I bought this. Well, on first use it stained so bad, despite my priming it, and worse, it warped. Hey, I can still use it. But it's kinda like wearing soiled clothes... won't feel as good

All of the above reviews are correct.  They are nice looking and moderately functional.  I may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has.  The stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out.  At $10.99 however, it was a great bargain, and a 4 star rating.  At it's current winter sale price of $16.99 however, it is a 1 star rating.  I'll average them weighting it's current price and give it 2 stars.

The turning weel is too small so the hose often falls off. The stake is round and too short, it won't stay in ground. Pretty much useless

They were on sale, and I ordered 2. They arrived separately in two HUGE boxes - via UPS - and looked like they had both been dropped from about 10 stories up. Sigh... The mats themselves had broken and cracked rubber backing. I guess they got beaten up in transit. The actual pattern in the mats is beautiful and the fiber is nice and dense. So - I kept them. They are outside and hopefully they won't fall apart too quickly.

If you are really picky, you better take a good look at these when they are delivered

I bought this in January and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around.  Now it is an hour off (one hour less than it should be) and won't reset to daylight savings time.  There is a button that resets it if you don't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either. Removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall.   No reply from the manufacturer.  Beautiful clock but useless half the year

This clock includes a chip that was designed to change the time.  When the new daylight savings time was effective the clock would not reset to the new time.  Interestingly the manufacturer has not removed the clocks from inventory or attempted to inform buyers of the issue as of yet. Other than that it is a beautifull clock

I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed.  Even though I've owned my clock for all of a month and a half, River City Cuckoo Clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect.  Since I would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics, I would be very wary about buying this clock

The product was, as advertised, easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since I installed it.  So far, it does not appear to have affected the mole population, however. To be fair, it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device (instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil, although the critters have dug quite close to it).  To be really bend-over-backwards fair, I suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles, although the telltale signs are exactly what I understand mole tunnels to look like.

Warning to all potential buyers!  This product is a total farce.  I bought four of these and placed them way closer than the required maximum distance.  And yes I put brand new Duracells in these things.  The moles actually burrowed right next to thems.  Save your money and buy the old fashioned traps that actually kill the moles.  These things don't work

I read the mixed reviews on this site before purchasing, so it's my own fault for still going ahead and purchasing!  I was hopeful the product would work for me.

I've tried 3 of these in different locations in my yard, all with the same result:  mounds of dirt leading right up to the Molechaser!  They seem attracted to it, not turned off by it.  I only wish I could upload a photo of the dirt mounds that literally are less than an inch away from each device!

This product has done nothing to discourage moles, voles, etc.  In all three locations, the lawn damage continues.

Don't make the same mistake I did.  Look for another solution rather than this product

Don't waste your money.  I bought two of these.  A few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year.  I put one in my gardern - a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight!  Total waste of money like everthing else I've tried except Nash loop traps

You have heard the old expression that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is?  This product is proof of that.  I really wanted to avoid poison and traps so I thought I would try this P.O.S. to solve my gopher problem humanely.  Sure I was skeptical, but some buyers reported success.  After 4 weeks, I can report that my gophers are utterly and completely indifferent to this product.  I noticed some buyers experienced a surge in activity, but I have seen nothing.  Nada.  Zip.    Numerous fat happy gophers before, numerous fat happy gophers after.

Sorry to say it, as I've liked Oregon Scientific products in the past, but this is a junker.  Two chief problems.  First is that it doesn't know how to switch over to daylight savings time correctly.  I understand that the switch-over dates were changed this year, but this is the more recent model clock, and the older RM826A has no trouble this year.  I got up an hour late on that first daylight savings time Sunday in March.  Sadly, even if you manually set the RM323A to the correct time, it will reset overnight to the wrong time.  The only way to fix this (per Oregon Scientific's web site) is to turn off the radio connection to the atomic clock, thereby defeating the reason for owning this clock in the first place.  (In fairness, O-S says that it will work fine after April 1, but what about future years when the dates change around?  My guess is same problem.)  The second problem is that it's very difficult to use, including such basic stuff as setting an alarm.  Granted, Oregon Scientific clocks don't have a lot of buttons, so it has to be a little complicated to handle all of the functions.  But this particular clock has both a "single alarm" and a "weekly alarm" that goes off every day at the same time, and selecting which one, setting the alarm time, and even just turning on and off the alarm is anything but obvious.

I suppose the world time capability could be useful for some folks, but I find this clock worse in every respect than the RM826A, which is no longer manufactured.  I'm going to toss this one in the trash and find a couple of RM826A's before they're no longer available.  Oregon Scientific has no more in stock as of a couple of days ago

Warmth from window affects thermometer! D'oh! It's totally inaccurate on single-pane glazing, very inaccurate on dual-pane glazing, and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri-rigged 6" extender from dual-pane glass. The nature of windows being a big source of heat loss means this thermometer is measuring *warm* ambient air, not actual outside temperature

The major problem with this device is its placement location in proximity to the indoors, e.g., on a window.  The indoor temp seems to affect the outdoor temp reading by anywhere from 3 to 7 degrees.  Would be better if it had a wire probe that extended further from the device.  Returned item.  Don't waste your money

I bought this weather station along with two remote sensors. After about two days I was skeptical about the inside humidity (reading 4%). To test the accuracy, I placed the remote sensors side-by-side with this unit. The temp seems to all be in sync, but I get different humidity readings on all three...this morning was 4% 27% and 31%. I have no idea which one is correct. I'm going to return this product

Just received this item purchased on 11/21, Unfortunately at that time there were no reviews on it.
Again as previous reviews state:
Item is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker as listed Still, but a Commercial Grade Cooker; this printed right on the box.
Features have now been changed, Orginally stated included with an aluminum basket and fish fry pot & basket. I received the items as listed now. All in All it does appear to be a nice cooker, but I bought it for the versitiliy of the features listed previously. Contacting Customer Service on this Misleading Advertisement.

As was the case with the previous reviewer, I did not receive the item that was described.  It is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker but a Commercial grade cooker.  In addition, there are no baskets included.  This set-up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment.  What you'll get is what is shown in the picture - not what is described

I ORDERED TWO OF THESE SETS AND WAS NOT SENT WHAT IS DESCRIBED.
THERE IS NO LARGE ALUMINUM BASKET AND NO FISH FRY BASKET INCLUDED.  THE DESCRIPTION SAYS IT IS PROFESSIONAL GRADE, BUT I RECEIVED COMMERCIAL GRADE.  CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS OFFERED TO SEND ME OUT A REPLACEMENT, BUT I AM ASSUMING THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  IT SEEMS AS IF AMAZON ATTACHED THE WRONG PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION TO THIS ITEM. BEWARE IF YOU WANT EVERYTHING THAT IS LISTED, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET

There is a reason this mitt is relatively cheap. The shape of it is very strange. It does not fit my hands at all. I have fairly wide hands and this mitt feels very ackward. It is tight to get into and the thumb is too short. I would return it except the postage would cost me more than the mitt did. I would suggest you buy in person someplace where you can put your hands in it first.

I found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use.  You can't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on.  You can move hot plates, etc. but you can't really carry anything with the mitt on.  Not worth the money albeit not very expensive.

These mitts are good quality. Problem is that the thumbs are way to short and narrow rendering these mitts virtually useless. Do yourself a favor and go to a store where you can try stuff like this before you buy.

While the mitt is beautiful and the price is right, it is narrow.  Most mitts flare towards the opening, this one does not.  I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up.  My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either.  Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow

A pretty simple device. Not really a waterfall concept of any kind. The water just plops into the first cup until it overflows into the next etc. Nothing runs down the chain. I suppose you could try to direct the water but it usually depends on the flow. It's mostly an asthetic piece

I tried it as recommended for over 4 weeks and then some, I did 
not see any reduction in the number of mosquitoes, actually there
seemed to be more in the same area where the unit was installed. 
I did try different locations. 

Perhaps they are attracted to it, but they are not being sucked in.

Looking at the tray, it did kill a bunch of other harmless flying insects

The Rion Mini Lean-To greenhouse comes in a flimsy cardboard box that contains about a hundred plastic parts. It difficult to put together because the parts are poorly labeled. (Making it even more difficult for me was that several parts were missing.) The 12 page instruction manual shows several diagrams - but no photos - with parts labelled to help with assembly. One classic exerpt on page 7, "The 'OUT' on the 2D connector should face the inside of the Mini Lean-To". This kind of product gives the term "some assembly required" a bad name. 

Also, it's a bit pricely to be so flimsy and poorly designed. Save yourself the trouble get something else.

Like other reviewers, initially I was impressed with these very stylish and comfortable chairs. However, after 1 year outside (in Colorado) the rubber on the arms was all cracked and peeling, and the cords were frayed. The overall appearance was of a much older chair. Of course, it happened to be my mother-in-law who sat in one of the chairs when it gave way. A second chair's cord gave way shortly afterwards.

What a joke, not worth the money. I put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through. Swapped batteries, pulled it out, washed it and looked at all the parts. It was either used and resold to me by amazon, or it was defective from the start. And since they have a 30 day return policy, I am now stuck with it, I will see what eastman says next. VERY disappointing, I will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it

The picture of this curtain makes it look thicker than it really is (by a long shot).  It does not "screen out unwanted pests, birds and harsh sunlight". Well, maybe birds, but certainly not bugs or light. There are large gaps between each strand of beads and it's completely see through.  This is not what you are looking for if you want a little privacy.

On a positive note, Amazon made the return very easy

The following quote direct from Oregon Scientific is WRONG:
"And the illuminated blue back-light means you never have to fumble around in the dark, the LCD automatically adjust to the light in the room, so you can read it when you need to."
We keep our clock accross from our bed, and the LED was not readable, and from there we couldn't reach it to press the Light button (which only lasts 8 seconds).  I took it into a completely dark closet and the LED did not light up at all; the clock could not be read without pushing the Light button. Apparently there is no way to keep the backlight on.  Unless you intend to keep this clock within reach so you can press the button to turn on the light (which only lasts 8 seconds), and you don't mind not being able to see the LED from across a room, this might not be a good choice.  I returned mine due to the above deceptive product description.  Regarding the projection: the Temp reading is larger than the Time (which doesn't make sense), and the image is only a few inches tall within readable focus; also, it doesn't show up clearly on textured walls

Very poor construction to the point where i had to return it to the manufacturer.
Pre-assembled bench seat had been over tightened so that metal screws were portruding through wood into seating area.
Aesthetically unappealing because of the diverse colors of the wood.
Definately would not reccomend this product.

The item in this picture is not the item I received.  When you buy from a picture, make sure you are prepared to be disappointed.  The frame of the stand is very thin, not wide as shown, screws are seen that attach to the stand, the bottom of the bowl is seen also.  The bowl has concrete as filler, with a complete circle of bowl, looks cheap.  The colors are washed out, the bird and flower also, not vibrant as shown.  This item came with nothing from Mfg., no instuctions on anything or who they are.  It was well wrapped and the package was ruined in removing. Apparently this was planned.  I was told I could send it back free of charge.  What am I going to send it in?  Good old Amazon offered me 20% off to keep it, this is apparently their standard screw-up fee {not my first experience}.  The item I received is not an $80 item, or a $64 item, it is in my yard, it will remind me where not to buy things in the future.  BEWARE!!!!

I purchased this in January and finally got a chance to use it for Easter.  It never registered a reading from the meat I was cooking.  Now I'm stuck with an expensive timer.  If you're thinking of purchasing this wireless thermometer, think twice

I don't think this product works - I installed 2 of them and my rooms are not that big. I saw a mouse even after that. I think I will have to engage professional pest control. If you are buying to control rodents don't bother to waste yr money

These devices, tested by the FDA decades ago (including the ones with variable and intermittent pitches) do not work.  There have been a number of class-action lawsuits against the companies that sell these.  They simply don't, and can't, work against insects or rodents. It's science

This was the worst purchase I've ever made in my crusade against the ants and spiders that have taken over my home!  I have MORE pests now than I did before.  Actually had ants crawling on one of the repeller units.  If you're thinking about buying this product... DON'T waste your money.  You'd be better off with a couple of cans of Raid

Absolutely useless.  The three gizmos are in three small adjoining areas -  Kitchen / Breakfast / Office areas.  The roaches come out at night and do a little dance to the "clicks" that the gizmos emit.  No effect whatsoever after 3 months

Very disappointed.  Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time.  Well, I think these units INVITE the ants in.  We've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room, etc.  These devices do not phase them at all - they continue to parade right by

We need a little more information.  The chair LOOKS great!  But what kind of material is it constructed from?  How big is it?  A side view would be helpful also to see how the back curves.  The price is good, now if I just knew a little more..

Okay, I am no Master Gardener, but then, this is not a product for a Master Gardener. I am also not wanted for botanicidal rampages. I bought this right after it first came on the market, did everything according to the instructions, found the perfect spot, etcetera, etcetera. About ten percent, if that, of the seeds sprouted, turned into little green shoots . . . and died. This herb garden is marketed as simple, follow-the-steps, sit-back-and-watch-it-grow. Not in my Universe! The only thing I admire about Chia Pet, Incorporated (or whatever the parent company might be named) is their skill at marketing. Each holiday season, as their commercials flourish, I am tempted. Then, I recall the Great Disaster of 1999, and I resist temptation

I bought this over a different product because I liked the smiley face/frowny face options & they don't even work. The frowning face is on there all the time regardless of the weather. It's kind of depressing. Also I think it's off by about 1 degree in general.

When  i did , there was no time display.  I waited for possible transmission overnight and positioned it to the north and the south sky, still no time. I changed the batteries several times, no results.  I will never buy this brand again

This item was a disapointment. Looks great in the picture but is cheaply made. Peices of the wicker were coming loose. The item is also very short. I am 5ft 10 and my feet stick off the end by a couple of inches. I guess you get what you pay for. If you spend $800-$1000 you will get much better construction and at the end of the day will last longer than this

This tray does not fit nicely inside the tool box grill.. it is about 2 inches short on the end and about a 1/2 inch too narrow.  This causes it to slide and bang around inside the grill when transported.  The tools have a very "cheap" feel to them. The tongs were the worst.. the handles are loose and they are prety much useless.  The knife won't hold an edge.  The spatula and tongs are marginal.  I would not recommend this item

There were problems with this outdoor fireplace right from the start. First,CharBroil failed to include the hardware for the fireplace to be assembled. It must be a common occurence because in huge letters, on the 2nd page of the manual, is the question "ARE YOU MISSING PARTS?"  Then, CharBroil did not make it easy to just get the packet of nuts and bolts. After calling the number that was provided, I was told proof of payment for the specific model had to be sent in first. After sending the required info, the missing hardware arrived in about two weeks.  Once assembled, it worked fine but it rusted some over just one summer's use and had to be touched up with heat resistant spray paint. The side screen doors flap in the wind because there is nothing to secure them in place. The rating of one star is because this just is not a quality product and CharBroil made me jump through the proof of payment hoop just to get the missing screws.

Bought a pair of these chairs to use at the beach. My chair collapsed within an hour on the first day at the beach while I was sitting in it reading. The mechanism for the recline positions is made of soft and cheap plastic and will not hold for long. I'm 200 lbs. My wife's chair showed signs of the same bent plastics and she's only 110 lbs. I returned them and will buy new ones with metal mechanisms

As a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the SW, I can say that red--or any other color--dye is nonsense!  NOT needed, quite likely harmful.  Also, I question the instant nectar--instructions say it doesn't require boiling.  Is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth?  If so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers: it could harm their natural internal flora

THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT STATE WHAT THEY USE FOR THE RED COLORING IN 
THEIR NECTAR.  IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT RED DYE #40 HAS PROVED
HARMFUL TO HUMMINGBIRDS CAUSING CANCER AND IS NOT NECESSARY.

NATURAL NECTAR IN THE WILD IS CLEAR WITHOUT COLOR.  USING A COLORFUL
FEEDER WILL ATTRACT THE HUMMERS AND NOT HARM THEM.

You won't find a single expert on hummingbirds who recommends "instant nectar" products such as this one. Why? Because 1) they're a complete waste of your money and 2) they expose the birds to ridiculously high concentrations of inadequately tested chemicals. The cheapest and easiest feeder solution also happens to be the closest in chemical composition to natural flower nectar: a solution of 3 or 4 parts water to one part ordinary white sugar. If you want the sugar to dissolve faster, get additive-free superfine baking sugar. DON'T use honey, food coloring, Kool-Aid, Jello, or any other junk - the birds drink nectar just for the energy and get everything else their bodies need from eating insects

I purchases this Gazebo and I thought it was a quality product, and found out after I erected it that it is made very cheap...The canvas looses color in about 2 months and the tie down clips for the top starts to rust and the elastic will stretch soon after....                                              Now when the wind hits the top it flaps and no longer is stable...             then the hold down clips one by one breaks off now the canvas top is at the mercy of the wind. I lost my canvas top one night and it riped off and destroyed the frame...to make a long story short..THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK AND DON'T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON IT.....To make matters worse I contacted the manufactor and was told that they were no replacement parts avalable....

You should stay away from this one: 

My wife an I bought this gazebo to use on our back patio. From the start it was a problem. The directions (probably translated from another language) were confusing. Beyond that, the letters on the diagrams and the letters on the parts themselves DID NOT MATCH, making it even more confusing. We did manage to muddle through. 

The gazebo uses cheap plastic hooks to hold the screens and canvas sides. When it arrived, some of the hooks were already broken. Within a couple of weeks of wind, more had broken. Replacement hooks are not available from the manufacturer.

Unlike the other reviewer, we did not find a problem with the stability of the structure. OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM is with the top. After the first summer, the nice chocolate brown top faded to a very light tan. The side also faded, but in a very uneven manner. We also noticed that where the clips attached to the fabric of the top there was fraying. By the end of the second summer, most of the clips had broken loose from the top, rendering is useless. I contacted the manufacturer, BOND MFG., who refused to sell us a replacement top. WE NOW HAVE A $500 PILE OF JUNK!!!!

Not at all what I expected. I started to install it and a light wind blew causing the structure to fall and bending it. I know its not an expensive product but I expected a better quality. Also I recieved it with some of the curtain hooks broken.I am going to return it

This clock worked fine.... until Congress changed the timing of Daylight Savings Time.  I have three other "atomic" clocks and two weather stations and all of them reset themselves to the new DST except this one.  I've "forced" a number of resets by removing and even changing the battery.  Each time this clock goes to the one of the 4, 8 12 positions and sits there until it receives the signal from Boulder.  Then it resets itself but always to Standard Time, one hour early.  I'm in the Eastern zone so I can't "cheat" it into showing the correct time and this model doesn't have provisions to set it manually.  La Crosse makes a big deal on their website about how other manufacturers leave you in the lurch on the DST thing but they have it covered.  Not.  And when you try to contact them they don't answer their phones and ignore customer emails.  Look elsewhere

I received a painful injury and almost lost my finger to this recliner. I grabbed the arm rest, and tried to slide back into the recliner. The mechanism under the arm rest snapped closed on my finger. I could not get out of this "trap". Had my wife not been there to help, I would have lost my finger. No way should this chair be sold to an unsuspecting public!

This reclines is as advertised. It is comfortable and great to use.

UNTIL a pivot bolt self locking nut backs off and the sholder bolt seperates allowing the chair to come apart causing the frame to bend when you wind up on the floor. This is the bolt that you raise and lower yourself from reclined to sitting positions.

BTW this happenerd today 7/25 and the chair was ordered on 5/31

The threaded part of the bolt is not lonf enough for the self locking nut to do its job.

Today is Sept. 4th 2005 an update on my Lafuma experience.

Called two days ago to the Lafuma people asking where my repair parts are, boy did they play dumb. Said I never called about broken chair parts. 

DO NOT buy this chair based on thier lousy customer service.

BTW they said this is a known problem with thire chairs, why then don't they correcxt it

My husband was so excited, when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up.  He is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right, only to have issues with 
the wind barameter.  We have tried to trouble shoot with the online and 
handwritten manuals.  

Unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box.. sooooo needless to say the 
excitement is gone..

Despite what it says on the Amazon web page AND what it says on the packaging itself, this does not fit my Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill purchased in April 2003 (it's about a half-inch too short). 

After finding out it didn't fit, I called Weber to find out what the deal is. After some checking and re-checking the Weber customer service rep said they don't sell the warm-up basket for my model of grill via retail outlets, and the only way to get it is from Weber directly. It cost a few dollars more but they didn't charge for shipping.

Fortunately Amazon's stelar customer service provided a prompt refund and did not charge me for return shipping;

I called Weber to verify the basket fits my Genesis silver B model and WEBER factory customer service informed me this item does not fit my model, which they had registered and knew what model I was referencing.  The guidance on many Weber accessories is incorrect according to what Weber customer service reps. are telling  customers.  Either Weber CS is wrong or the Weber person filling in the detail on the items is wrong.  I strongly suggest Weber managment cross check all detail on Amazon for accuracy and/or straighten out their service reps..  This was a bad experience and occurred on multiple accessories I was trying to buy.

I am already on my second unit. I managed to get three uses out of the first one. I should have ordered the second when I saw the first one start smoking halfway through draining the turkey fryer. (No, the oil was not hot, it was at room temp.!) THe only reason I gave a second star is that it did work well, once. I really wish Eastman would re-design this to make it durable. I've given up and use PVC tubing from Home depot and a funnel with cheesecloth to get the residuals out. Good luck to anyone who wants to use this a second time

You should remove this merchant. They have numerous complaints on multiple websites. I ignored it and trusted amazon's brand. However, my experience was Horrible - they over charged me and when I called to rectify the issue, they weren't interested in trying to solve the problem, but simply place blame on me. Then the service rep hung up on me. I'll never do business with them again.

one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items. i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point. i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a $10 tie for his birthday.

If you read the label on this stuff it says 100% sucrose and that is what this stuff is plain and simple sugar. You're basically paying $10 dollars for something you could get at a grocery store for $1.50. This is a rip off! There is nothing special about this stuff in terms of size color everything!!! Just buy sugar!!!!!

This product to my knowledge is completely untested.  I suspect it because it says it requires no boiling--which sugestes that it may contain a preservative, yeast and/or bacterial inhibitor.  This could not possibly be good for the hummers.

Listen to the experts such as Sheri Wlliamson (Peterson's "Hummingbirds of North America.")  Sugar and water is just fine, filtered water best but NOT distilled

When I bought this product, it was said to be "new"!  However, upon opening the package it arrived in, the cooker was in an already opened inner box.  I though that perhaps someone just opened the inner box to check the item before it was sent?  As I opened the inner box, one of the "legs" on the cooker was broken off and rusted!  I needed to use this right away so I did not send it back.  Now I will have to get this "leg" welded back on!  Beware of the "new" designation!

I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order

No matter where I set my temperature controls on the grill, this thermometer always reads the temp at 500 degrees or more. I placed the thermometer in our oven and set the oven for 350 degrees yet the thermometer showed the temp at 450-500. I have called Taylor's customer service on several occasions and they never bother to call back. I would never buy another Taylor product

For the price I paid I expected much more accuracy.  The data it downloads from its external monitor to the PC is terrible.   Even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database.  It also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall.  The amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount.  The hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically. You might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later, the last 24 hours shows only .2 inches of rain.  Strange.  How can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24?  Seems backwards.

On the good side, the unit is easy to set up and connects to your PC with existing ports and a cable that is provided.  On the bad side, besides being inaccurate, the analysis software is primitive and difficult to work with.  You are better off downloading a text file and doing analysis in Excel.   

This unit also gives eratic readings with the temperature swinging up and down up to six degrees within a twenty minute window.  I wanted my son to see how the temps over a 24 hour period form a bell shaped curve.  So much for that.  This is probably OK for a first time weather station for my 8 year old but I would not recommend it for any one else since this unit is not cheap.  

One other thing, it only takes a reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings are hit and miss.  You could be getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens to read.  I am dissapointed and annoyed that I spent the money and it is not at least semi-accurate.  I will tell you that I have it set up wireless.  If you use the enclosed hard wire connection option then you will get more frequent readings and maybe even better accuracy.  Good luck and do your homework first.

I received the Lacrosse weather station as a gift. It started out working ok for about 4 weeks. Plagued by software and communication problems I do not recomend it to anyone. The tecnical support team is of little or no help.It all goes back to that old saying,you get what you pay for.
A Very Dissatisified Customer.

I had the La Crosse WS-2310 "Professional" Weather Station for 2 years, and it was NEVER fully functional.  I had to return the unit 3 times, as well as do a store replacement once, and I used the system for a year without the wind speed unit working - I simply didn't want the cost of returning the system yet again.  The software is absolutely horrible, and during the 2 years I had the system, there was never any software upgrades at all.  Given how deficient the software was, this was quite surprising.  For example, there is no calculation of daily rain amounts or monthly rain amounts.  The system is too stupid to differentiate between days.  The date recorded to the simple spreadsheet database is always one day off (yesterday's date is recorded today).  Overall, the software looks to be a high schooler's science project done the night before it was due. If you're going to purchase a La Crosse system, plan on spending money on 3rd party software, as well as allowing about 30% of your purchase price in product return costs. La Crosse tech support is non-existant: call & get a recorded message to leave your number & they will return the call - but they NEVER do... and I do mean NEVER!  Send an email and the same response - NONE!  It's a very frustrating joke.  After 2 years, I gave up and purchased a truly professional system from a competitor.  My only regret was having waited 2 years to throw in the towel with La Crosse.  I give La Crosse 1 star only because there is no 0 star rating

I got this Weather Station last Christmas and have had a few problems with it.

1. The Wind Gauge reads low. During Hurricane Katrina the maximum recorded reading was 28MPH versus gusts of 75MPH. The trees can be bent over from the wind and it reads 5MPH.

2. The unit will just stop transmitting from the outside unit to the base unit. We have changed the batteries in the outside unit 4 times in the past year but continue to have this problem. Better than 50% of the time now nothing works from the outside unit. The range is now down to less than 50ft from the base station. I don't want to move the station any closer to the house because the wind and rain sensors will be impacted.
 
3. The rain gauge does not update very often and it reads significantly lower than the local weather station. It rained heavy last night and the local news reported 1 inch of rain but we recorded 0.2 inches. 

4. The barometric pressure appears to work well. 

There are better buys out there like the Oregon Scientific WMR968 that have a real 330 ft range so save your money

I just tried filling my propane tank with the quick disconnect connector and was told by the dealer that this type of connector has now been banned by the government and he could not fill my tank.  I called Weber and they confirmed this.  Probably a safety concern although I never had a problem.  I will now need to replace my grill LP hose with the screw on type of connector (QCC1 connection).

Shame on me!  I should have read the reviews before I purchased this piece of garbage.  I had the same experience as others--cumbersome to fill, trouble attaching to the window, then the whole thing crashes to the deck.  An atractive price until you find you're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped, not to mention the poor quality design. Couldn't give me another one of these ...

Well, I ordered this online as we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally. It's lasted exactly two weeks. The problem is the extremely weak design: the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy-too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups, as this has. There are somewhat strange instructions with this model, directing the user to &quot;rub&quot; the suction cups for several minutes in order to (supposedly) build up a proper &quot;suction&quot;-then the glass slides into a groove; well, the thing worked at first-until I had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it. I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess. What a crummy product! And overpriced-although I wouldn't buy it again for two cents. Beware

It is a little difficult to make use of all the watch's features. I am very concerned the watch is stamped on the back "water resistant" but new reports are showing it is not. In fact if it is NOT, we have been misled by the manufacturer. Overall, I can not recommend this watc

I had this watch for a few months, and feature wise it meets all my expectations, but I snagged it in my backpack the other day and the strap with the pins came off.  No big deal I thought, I'll just snap it back in - that's when I noticed that the strap holder had ripped through the PLASTIC casing and was thus unrepairable. Over the few months I have had it, it has also discolored badly on the fake metal casing. Great features, poor build quality. Not recommended
