I got this light before the LED lights started coming out in the retail channel.  Those lights tend to almost be too bright, but they have the advantage of running for ages on tiny batteries.  Unfortunately, this light uses 4 AA batteries which makes it fairly hefty.  It alternatively can operate on an AC adapter.  This makes it lighter, but it's still bulky because of the battery compartment.

The Good:
The light is nicely bright with a natural quality that's easy on the eyes.
It has a ratcheting arm so you can put it where you want and it stays there (better than most of the flexible arm ones)
Includes an AC adapter slot (though no AC adapter)
Can help weigh down lighter books to keep the pages from turning
Nice large clamp for attaching to books.
Lamp shade which allows you to throw the light where you want without blinding your vision.
Decent quality plastic - Made in China

The Bad:
No brightness adjustment.
Heavy (can be a benefit in some cases) and makes holding up a book all the more tiring.
Bulky - Makes it really hard for a book to sit properly in your hand.
The ratcheting mades a loud click which can wake your wife in bed.  :-)
The clip has very limited strength and seems to slip easily.
Eats up batteries fairly quickly - I use rechargeables in it now.

I'm giving it an even 2 because it's a pain to use, really.  Hopefully I can find a light weight LED clip-on which has a brightness adjustment with a quiet arm that stays in place and most importantly - natural lighting.  If so, I'll review it on here - but most LEDs wash out the page making it hard to read.  The nice quality lamp is the only reason this one doesn't get 1.5 stars

If you are buying this set for a beginner (i mean JUST STARTED PLAYING) then fine, this set DOES NOT come with the cymbals and even if it did come with the hi-hats, crash cymbal, and ride cymbal, they would be terrible sounding. If you have been playing for a few years dont get this set, this set really is only meant for kids and early beginners, because I'm 14 and have been playing for 4 years, and i'm still a beginner and i would not buy this set, so think it ove

Rockin' Red Guitar, eh? Perhaps rockin' should ready "rocky," as the plastic case is easily broken by any youngster... or oldster, for that matter. Additionally, this "toy" comes pre-stringed with some form of non-natural strings, supposedly nylon -- two of these non-gut strings broke when attempting to ellicit some music from the item. Definitely not for a young child! It probably wouldn't last for a half-hour under constant use by smaller folk

I bought this item for my son's piano practice. It worked ok in terms of sound and speed, until the second day when the on/off switch broke off. Then I noticed that the plastic attachment the switch had was very thin to start with. In my opinion, this is a flaky product since the on/off switch will be used many times every day and so it has to be sturdy.

cheap, cheap, cheap- I know you get what you pay for, but 20 bucks(after shipping) is a lot to pay for nothing in return. The thing didn't respond to my guitar, and the store said that it's probably defective and to return it. But, you don't get repaid for any of the shipping, so it's hardly worth the effort. Buying this just resulted in headache and frustration.

Better just to throw it away rather than saddle someone with a mistake I made. Thank goodness, it was not costly...do not waste your money on this toy tuner...this tuner is not sensitive enough for any use at all..Cannot buy a worthwhile, more costly instrument? Go to Guitarplayersclub.com, a site Fender put up for ama and pro players alike....there is a tuner there, FREE that comes very close to the expensive one...Exception? No where to put your quarter.....

I have been buying tuners for 45 years.  I wish I had not bought this one. I bought it months ago.  I cannot open the battery door to put in a battery.  There must be some trick to it that I do not know.  I have lots of tuners and like to have different ones and I am hardly a novice.

Can't someone let us know how you do this

Contrary to the vendor's arrival date, one of my items have been placed on backorder for nearly a month. I was not notified about the change and only found out when I inquired by phone. The customer representative did not apologize for the company and did not offer any form of resolution for the inconvenience. The first product arrived in good shape and on-time, but I am dissatisfied with the customer service when a mistake is made

I bought this low priced pedal mainly for my daughter as a starter. To my surpise, there was no power supply included! Not even a battery. No mention on Amazon's product description that a power supply for the unit was not included. I also bought the other two models... One of them picks up a radio station and broadcasts it thru the amp, yet, there isn't a radio station tower within 5 miles of my house. All in all, I feel I got ripped off. If I had known they did not come with power supplies, I would not have purchased them

I first ordered this guitar in another color and after about a week of checking the mail with my little boy every day, I was informed that it was out of stock. I re-ordered in the bodacious blue and it came Friday. It literally came in the cardboard box that you would buy it off of the shelf in with no packing besides a plastic bag around the guitar like your newspaper would come in. There was NO PACKAGING SLIP. I took it out of the plastic and the body of the guitar was damaged around the edge. There was a little divit the size of a raisin where it looked like it had hit something pretty hard. There was literally slack in the strings, so they had to be tightened. It would not stay in tune and I would tighten the strings and you could see them loosen again immediately. My little boy began to play with the out of tune guitar that sounded TERRIBLE and the next day one of the strings broke!!! This toy is a piece of junk. The sales pitch says a fully functional guitar... great value for the money.... HAHAHA! I thought this would be a great starter guitar with little investment. I would only recommend this if you are needing a prop or decoration of some kind. It certainly isn't playable! I have no slip to send it back and what I would have to pay in shipping would probably be near what I paid for the thing. Don't waste your money!

The string screws are very loose and the strings won't stay tight. Though I know it is only a kid's guitar, it is pretty useless because the strings won't stay on. We bought two and both are the same way. Stay away from this

this item is cheap junk i bought this item and when i got it it didn't work and after hours of fiddling with it it finally worked but the sound was terrible and when i pulled the plug out of the back after a day it said it was chargable but it wasn't it would not work without the plug attached to it and when i started to play it it kept making this annoying banjo like sound and it wouldn't stop and you can not play any fast songs on this because it   can't keep up and you can not play more than one note at a time and the keys aren't really raised it is just like pressing cell phone buttons and the plastic is so cheep it almost broke when i pressed one button and after shipping and handling the total was about $56 DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM CHEAP JUNK if you want a roll up keyboard go look somewhere else

I have "installed" this item and it sits here and collects dust due to the buggy , immature install design, you have to hook up cables to parallel and serial ports and if you don't have them then "simply" add them.. crap , Should be redesigned as a simple external box with usp2 interface.. this is a lousy product. michael Railey Dallas, tx.

1. Forget the headphones, if you're interested in playing guitar, you need to actually hear what you play. So, replace them, first thing.

2. The amplifier is terrible, so if you want this thing just to practice at home... well, supposing you care nothing for the sound then it's ok. But then, why play guitar in the first place?

So, to sum it up, if you play guitar, and you respect yourself, spend some money and buy something decent. This is an item you may want to give away as a birthday present to a 7-year old

I'm really dissapointed with this guitar. I just bought it and after 3 days of being tuned the bridge cracked completely. Sound was nice but for using the guitar only during 3 days, it's non acceptable. I made sure that string were not overstressed and tuned with electronic tuner having just the top 3 sets of strings (D,A,E) tuned an octave apart (The G was tuned in the same octave) to avoid stress on the guitar. But even with that, the bridge cracked. The wood on the bridge is not rosewood but a low quality wood, that was the cause of the damage

This trumpet is of extremely low quality, despite what any other review may say. Most of those reviews are written by non-musicians, likely parents who were looking for a good deal. Granted the instrument is playable, it will seriously constrict the development of a player. This instrument is most likely from china, which in recent years has sent out thousands of low quality instruments at cheap prices. Check out ebay, theres always hundreds of these trumpets under various names such as Laval, Bessler, and Weimer. 

Just remember, you get what you pay for. Although even used name-brand student trumpets may cost more, they are of much better quality and can last a lifetime.

Stick to name brands like Bach, Yamaha, Conn, Selmer, King, Kanstul, etc. If you have any doubts, give it a quick search at google

I gave this item a rating of 1 star only because it was the lowest offered, otherwise it wouln't have even received a star. This item is extremely low quality and one of the valves was bent upon arrival, it stuck, the trumpet was not playable. We took it to a music store only to be informed that it was not repairable... I would say if you are looking for a quality trumpet, keep looking because if you purchase this, you may as well flush your money down the drain

The only song I know with a 12-string electric in it is Rush's Xanadu, so I let 'er rip.  Sounded good.  I had alot of fun playing around with it.  However, after an hour or so of goofing around I noticed two things that really ticked me off.  Firstly, the outer tines had already broken.  The tines look like a wound steel guitar string, but the core is very brittle.  They didn't completely fall off, they just hung there like limp whatevers.  Secondly, the plastic p'up cover and pick guard looked like they had been scrubbed with a wire brush.  I can easily fix those, but I wonder what such an abrasive pick will do to the strings if I play it alot.  It looks like you can only strum on the down stroke.  Videos of the jellyfish website confirm this.  The problem is you're going against the grain on the upstroke and it catches on the strings.  How much fun is it to only play down strokes?  It's kind of hard grasp, too.  It needs a thumb dimple.

I'm going to make one using more flexible wound guitar stings to see if its any better.

If you've got $10 to blow, go ahead and get one

The Jellifish is no replacement for a twelve string guitar. You can not play it fast, it is fragile, and the tone is scratchy. That being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing. It is not something I would use often. My 1.00 mm Clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the Jellifish. After one hour of use the Jellifish is starting to show signs of wear and tear. So don't say you weren't warned.

You know how when a regular pick hits your strings, you can hear the sound of it hitting the string, then after it releases and the string reverberates you hear a note?  Well imagine hearing 15 picks hit the string before the string produces music.  And the 15 picks are made of coiled wire.  

I can't imagine a worse sound or feeling.

I ordered this guitar for my grandson for Christmas.  There is no way to keep the strings tight even though you turn the screws to tighten.  When you do tighten, the strings are brittle (as if really old) and break.  To get a refund on this item you have to obtain an RMA, pay for return shipping (which will probably be almost as much as the guitar) and they will issue a refund after they receive the guitar back. So I will probably be out about $10.00!

This is an adorable guitar and it's the perfect size for my two year old  but it's made cheaply.  The strings loosen after he strums it for a couple of  minutes which means I'm retightening the strings each time he plays with it. I  guess you get what you pay for (afterall, it  was only $14.99)!

I was very disappointed in this product.   It is for a child and yet the wood string holder was not even attached to the guitar.  This product lasted a whole two days before the part fell off and you could no longer use the guitar.   The tuners also were unable to tighten so you basically had a piece of useless wood shaped like a guitar.

I'm a guitar player that decided to pick up the drums as a second instrument, and also to help in developing a better sense of rhythm. 

In the course of my studies, I happened across the DD-20C, and it seemed to offer some really nice features for what seemed like a reasonable price. The unit itself has 10 preassigned drum kits, plus the ability to assign your own custom setup. In addition, it offers 16 special effects, 4 drum roll effects, adjustable tempo, and 100 different styles to play along with which cover a wide range of genres. Not only that, but it offers the package in a very intuitive interface that will get even the rank beginner up and going quickly. Sounds like a pretty nice deal, right? It would be... if it worked like it's supposed to. 

Actually I'm on my second set right now, and this one is about to go back for a refund. The first set I had the pads were so insensitive as to make the unit nearly unplayable. What I mean by this is that there was maybe a square inch or so of a sweet spot where the pads would sound at all, and even then I really had to strike hard. The second set I'm on now is far better in response than the first, but still falls short of acceptable. 

For starters, the pads don't feel like a real drum skin at all. If one were to compare against an acoustic snare drum for example, the snare has a certain "bounce" to it that this unit doesn't have. Basically the pads absorb most of the impact, and this in turn makes doing any kind of fast work or rudiments all but impossible. 

Also, even though my second set is more responsive from the first, I have found that it still takes a considerable amount of force in comparison to a real drum to get the pads to sound off. Keep in mind that the pads themselves are only 4 inches or so in diameter... an actual snare starts at 12". In all fairness though, I really can't hold the pad size alone against the DD-20 as Yamaha did have to keep the overall size and cost manageable, and in reality if there weren't the feel and responsiveness issue, the pad size should be sufficient. HOWEVER, when these combined factors are taken into consideration, I have found that it makes for a frustrating experience. 

My opinion for what it's worth, is that new drummers who are looking to the DD-20 to learn on should do it the old-school way, and start with a quality practice pad instead. They are considerably less expensive (a ReelFeel 12" pad and sticks will run about half of what this unit costs), indestructible, easier to work with, and offer at least a reasonable approximation of the feel of a real drum. Not only that, but a pad also inherently allows for quiet practice.

Maybe Yamaha will fix the feel and sensitivity problems with the next revision of this drum set... then it might be worth it. Until then, I feel that the DD-20C is best avoided.

Package arrived in good condition, however.....i spent alot of money on this item .......is very small for what you get and then the ac adaptor doesn't even come with it!! These toys are getting more expensive and then don't include any accessories for what you pay for. I like yamaha products but would be very careful in future to buy items like these from online.

We received the product on-time, however the oil container had leaked inside the Trumpet box, and it smelled real bad.  We had to leave the box in the sunshine for almost a week, and still it smells bad.
As for the trumpet itself, after a few lessons at school, one of the keys keeps getting stuck, and has to be manually pulled out to the normal position

Contrary to the product description, this stool is not heavy duty! The actual seat itself is made of very flimsy plywood, and any sort of bad posture or leaning forward will crack it and punch the metal supports through it!

The legs are also hard to adjust to optimum length, as the retention screw doesn't hold anything in place for long. If you can find something somewhere else, I say go for it
