The actual cheese is GREAT, if you can get them to ship to you.  Ordered items as gifts - took over a week to ship.  For timely gifts you would be better off going around the corner.  Otherwise a great deal

I expected something softer in texture, but these are like chewing on rubber with flavor.  Much too hard for my 3 y/old child.  If you're looking for something tasty & softer in texture, try Kasugai Gummy Candies

After reading a number a positive reviews on the product, I wanted to try it.  I am glad I just went to my local Whole Foods Supermarket, instead of paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online.  Basically, I do Not like it...don't like the taste or texture; I am not really bothered by the smell once it is rinsed.  

I eat Tofu products regularly and I also eat pasta occasionally and would rather eat my whole wheat pasta 1-2x/mth than eat this tofu-noodle regularly.  However, everyone has different tastes. So if you want to try it, get it from your local grocer (if they carry it), otherwise don't waste your money on ship/g

This small package of noodles came to me in a huge box, which I thought was a huge waste and completely unnessecary.  And, when I opened the box, a small melted ice pack failed to keep the noodles cold, so they were hot and smelled terrible.  I had to throw them in the trash outside right away because of the smell, and called Gristedes and left an upset, yet polite message.  It has been almost a week and I have not heard from them.  Don't waste your money on this supposedly "great deal."  It's not worth it

As a vegan, I have tried just about every tofu product on the market, and nothing ever came close to the terrible texture of these noodles.

The smell when you opened the bag was not pleasant, but if you wash them off and parboil, that goes away, but is replaced with a slightly sweet smell that I disliked almost as much.

But I kept an open mind, cooked the noodles for a few minutes, added my favorite sauce and fresh ground pepper with some soy cheese grated on top.  Whoever said it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target, they are incredibly chewy and just don't taste that great either. Even as a low calorie food, it seems like a waste to spend 40 calories on these noodles.

This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.  It has a chemical taste, like you're eating spun plastic, and makes you actually scared to eat it.  Why even bother eating it.  I'll stick with fat free whipped topping -- at least it has flavor

I like some of the other Walden Farms products -- I gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one is not very good. I tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it, tried it in combination with the chocolate dip, and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away. The cellulose gel Walden Farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy/sour "bite" to it; it doesn't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings, but here it ruins the flavor

I was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements.  I had nothing but high hopes.  I was totally open minded.  I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own

I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own

I was on a search to find a great oolong tea.  This set contained one somewhat weak black tea, two green teas, and a VERY strong jasmine. I much prefer black teas so tried one cup of each and then gave these away. Perhaps if you have a more exotic tea taste, this would be a better choice for you than it was for me. So far, the very inexpensive Bigelow oolong has come closest to a true oolong black cup of tea.

Fine cut, diamond texture whatever, it's missing the thing vital to really be popcorn salt and that is the flavor that true popcorn salt has. Slightly buttery, very strong, and always good. There;s a trend lately to re-lable regular salt as popcorn salt, this trend needs to stop

I used to give Omaha Steaks as gifts, thinking i'm giving a good gift. Recently, I ordered these for myself and was embarassed.  
These steaks are yummy but are tiny, don't let the pictures fool you. They are small to begin with & after cooking are laughably tiny. Add the cost for the expensive shipping and handling, I could have done much better at my local butcher/supermarket. Save your money.

The photo shows four containers, each 9oz.  The product is actually only one 9oz. container.  Very misleading, possibly intentionally so.  Also, shipping costs $10 for a $9 product?  Give me a break!  On top of it all the chocolate is nothing special, you can get 16oz containers of Ghiradelli drinking chocolate in specialty shops for $10 which tastes better

Good black tea is not hard to find - just hard to find in your grocery store.  

The honest truth is that Tazo really does not make many, if any really good teas.  This, in particular, is one of their worst.  It is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately.

Every time i get stuck in a starbucks with friends i am faced with the choice - tea, chai or steamed milk.  Every time i cave in and give Tazo another chance it disappoints me.  If you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop and let them brew you a few cups.  Try a keemun, a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong and see how it goes.  If you really want to kick it up a notch look for a 
Cameroonian black.

take it from someone who really loves tea, this stuff is not worth your time.  and when you get good tea, please don't brew it in your coffee maker

I proceeded to open the container then pour it all over myself, in front of my girlfriend. Imagine my embarassment with poweder all over myself.

Needless to say the evening did not go as planned.

Though I did take a bath, and the water did taste an awfully lot like milk.

My fault though, for thinking the company was Nido Powde

I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee.  I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand.  Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf

I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?

Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really

I can't believe that this is considered a "Gourmet Food". In the UK long life UHT milk is an excellent standby when you run out of fresh milk, and it tastes much better than this Parmalat. OK, brands differ and taste is a matter of preference and there are mixed opinions as to whether the UK UHT milk tastes as good as pasturised, but many are just as happy with it as fresh. There is no way that the Parmalat could be mistaken for fresh milk.

And how expensive. Just add Gourmet to the title and up the price! In the UK it is similar or cheaper than fresh milk.

I can't understand why it is not more available in the USA.

I have multiple concerns with this product. Out of the box, they really do look fresh and plump like they do in the picture. 

However, you soon notice the lack of instructions. None. The only documentation at all is a "California" sticker... with no reference to a web site. Nada.

My grapes broke quickly. When I received them they looked just like the picture. But in a couple days I started noticing they weren't as plump and were shriveling. Withing a week, many were brown and certainly lacked freshness. It was so bad, that I was in shock, and I kept holding up the picture next to them to compare because I couldn't believe it. It was like they were deteriorating right before my eyes.

Within a month they looked awful. They looked like moldy raisins. Really Moldy.

Not recommended

I thought that I would try out this product, since i've tried a number of green teas, and after trying this I was not at all impressed with it by any means.  I don't recommend this product...there was no kind of "flavor" to this to me, and i've been all over the orients.  Just my opinion, but hope someone else enjoys it better than I did

I thought my Fresh Vine Ripe Tomatoes would come whole.  Instead, as you can see from the graphic, I received five whole tomatoes and one that had already been cut in half.  Yes, half a tomato.  The half-tomato in my package had dripped on the other ones and made quite a mess.  In fact, the resulting tomato juice ate a hole through the box they arrived in, making a puddle on the floor that was small, but big enough to trip the UPS guy.  He fell and fractured his spine, and now he's paralyzed.  His wife and nine children are destitute, all thanks to these vine-ripened tomatoes.

In conclusion, I think this packaging is just a bad idea

So really, how important is this fruit, err vegetable, err fruit?  I mean, I like salsa, and a hamburger just would not be the same without catsup, err ketchup.  Come to think of it, spaghetti would not be the same either.  But eating these things plain is just silly.  The taste is not so bad, but the consistency is all messed up.

In conclusion, if you must have some tomato in your diet, please purchase tomato related products and not the tomato itself.  And why the heck isn't it spelled "tomatoe"?  Why is the "e" added for the plural form?  What gives

I find tomatoes to be overrated.  They're an important ingredient in many things, obviously, but as an item themselves they're of limited use.  They taste alright, but their texture is too screwed up.  The only time I ever really eat raw tomatoes is on hamburgers and sandwiches, and usually prefer not to have them, as they destablilize the whole sandwich so that it all falls apart.  Obnoxious, that is

Thought it would make a cute Easter gift, no one else thought so, kids are in counselling now. Apparently I'm the only one with a sense of humor in this family.
 At least it's a hit with the dog, one extra star for that. I'm way too scared to even try to take it away from him, he loves it so much. 'Heh, OK SirFluffles,' I say to him, 'it's YOUR fresh whole rabbit.'

These big internet companies are so good at screwing their companies. Do you see how this scam works??? They sell "FRESH WHOLE RABBIT" but when I order it, there's no head or skin! Can you believe?!

Uh, excuse me, do you think a headless rabbit missing its entire skin is "WHOLE"???

This is totally misleading. I have contacted Amazon 3 times asking them to please send me the skin, feet, and head so I have the complete set and they have ignored me or sent me autoresponder emails that don't specifically address the missing head and so on.

What they do, I'm guessing, is then resell rabbit heads, rabbit feet, and bloody rabbit scalps on another part of this website, and it's all pure profit. What a CROCK

Twinkies were once great but once they sold out to the big corporation, the quality went down the drain. It's too artificial tasting to be considered food. There are a ton of chemicals and additives added. You call this cake

Come on, this is 2005. Twinkies aren't "food" anymore than Cheez Whiz is. Twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies. Consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines. Everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while - I'm just as guilty of that - but eating Twinkies is practically self-mutilation. Look at the ingredients list and do some reading. Yikes! Everyone's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too. Sorry Hostess, that definitely does not include Twinkies

I placed an order for these beans on March 4th. On the 14th march, I did not receive them as yet. Since the occasion that I needed them for has passed, I sent an email to JR to find out the problem. When he said they were not shipped as yet, I send 2 e-mails requesting cancellation-i sent 2 to make sure they got it and stopped the mailing of my item!
He responded VERY hastily, as used sarcastic comments in his reply.The tone of his reply made me feel as if I did not know anything!!

 I am very disappointed with this whole ordeal!

These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.

Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much.

Why doesn't Amazon allow people to sell *used* lettuce? I bought "To Kill a Mockingbird" used last week via amazon and saved about 90% off the original price. I don't think it's fair that they are not allowing us to sell it used via Paypal.

I know of many people who would love to have an elk carcass for their holiday.  Birthdays, Christmas, Hanukkah, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday Observed, Grandparent's Day, etc. are all holidays where a big piece of elk meat could brighten someone's day.  But watch out!!! I have often used Amazon in order to buy gifts, and with this elk carcass GIFT WRAPPING IS NOT AN OPTION.  I would think that half the fun of giving a huge elk carcass would be watching the look on your loved one's face as he or she unwrapped the slab of meat.  Unfortunately, Amazon does not think this is so.  With the weight of the product, I think it is going to be difficult to wrap this on my own.  Sorry Uncle Tino, no elk carcass for Columbus Day this year!

I'm very disappointed with this gift basket. The contents that I received were far less than as pictured and described in the web page. The price of $85.90 is very expensive for this item and definitely not worth it. I ordered 4 items from Wine Country Gift Baskets totalling over $230 and had to return all items due to unsatisfactory products/contents. I spent almost $30 in shipping charges which they refused to reimburse me. I would never order or recommend Wine Country Gift Basket to anyone

Product ad states 64 pods but they only shipped 16! When I called all they would refund was shipping, then I complained and they said $8 refund. So I asked for a return shipping lable and FULL refund. The CSR Amy was kind but her options from J&R were unacceptable

Personally, I didn't like Tazo's Red Bush Tea very much.  I've had three different kinds of roiboos teas so far and this was my least favorite.  It seems like the flavor of roiboos itself is pretty mild, and in the case of Tazo's tea, the flavors they add completely overwhelm it.  I found that I had to remove the tea bag very quickly lest the cup become overwhelmingly lemony and acidic.  Perhaps other pallettes will appreciate the strength of those flavors.  Personally, I couldn't wait to finish off the box so that I could find a better flavor.

The other roiboos teas I have tried have had a milder mix of flavors, to a much better overall effect.  My personal choice right now is Trader Joe's Orange Spice Roiboos, which apparently can be bought in some, but not all of their stores.  The orange flavor is much less up front than the lemon & citrus flavors in the tazo tea, and the overall effect of the other spices is very nice.  The tea smells a lot like other spiced foods (pumpkin pie comes to mind) and is very nice on a gloomy afternoon.  Also unlike the Tazo version, the flavor of this tea gets nicer and richer the longer you let the tea bag steep, although even just pouring the water over the bag and leaving it for a few seconds is usually enough for a nice cup.  Admittedly, there are a lot of other roiboos teas I have not tried, but this one has been a hit with me because of its good flavor and local availability.

Keep in mind this is not the opinion of a tea expert, and I have never had roiboos tea in Africa so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like in its authentic presentation.  Just my personal taste

i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i'd give this a try. These are gross... not only that, but they're huge. i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative. Now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first,before investing in my next 5 pound bag. 2 stars because well it's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible, but still, now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of

I use a variety of sugar free products including others by Wisconsin Cheeseman.  How they missed so badly on this product amazes me.  Normally I like the items from thier list but this fudge sent me into a severe bout of bathroom time after eating 2 small pieces.  Don't know if it was a batch with the ingredient mix off but once was enough to have me tossing the rest of the package in the trash.  No way would I recommend this for ANYONE.  Try the cherry cordials or the peanut butter cups but leave this off your list.

Okay,i just got my UPS delivery.
1) these are half the size of a real donut.
2) dry,overpriced and just terrible
3) no flavor and horrible presentation
4) totally overpriced and not worth the money

I recently bought the low fat donuts recommended in the oct issue of "Every Day With Rachael Ray" Holey Donuts Ultra Low Fat Gourmet Donuts and these low fat donuts are full size,packed and shipped in a frozen cooler and oh my god they have REAL cinnamon buns that have 3 grams of fat,double the size and yes they cost more but everything arrives frozen ,thaws soft and moist and just blows this way

At first glance the price sounds reasonable, but wait until you peel these things. Strip off the peel and there's another one. Peel that off and there's another one underneath. I removed the third one and, you guessed it, another one beneath that. Frustrated, I kept peeling and peeling and finally, right at the center, was this tiny little sliver. After peeling the whole bag I was left with only about an ounce of this pungent vegetable. Talk about a ripoff

Two weeks ago I saw these onions out behind the Denny's on 81st. They were speaking perfect English. Not a hint of a Spanish accent. Then just yesterday I was at a rendition of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and I saw one of them pretending to be German. It's all a SHAM!!! These are simple American onions trying to be pretentious and pass themselves off as something exotic. Don't believe the hype

We were happy with the gift baskets that were delivered. However the company only has one distribution center in California, which is obviously not efficient to deliver to the East Coast. 
Despite the company's ambitions to become a national company, they are not willing to pony up the money to get additional distribution facilities outside of California. 
This maybe great if you live in California. However I live in Florida and I ordered on December 22 and my basket did not arrive until January 4th. I think that would be unacceptable in anyone's view, espescially since giving a gift basket can be time-sensitive. 
Until this company gets with the program and gets other distribution facilities I would stay away unless you want to wait two weeks for a simple basket to be delivered.

I must write quickly, for soon, soon, the Milk will awake within me again.  And it will know, but you will have been warned.  The Milk will punish me, but it knows it must have a host, so I will survive - tormented and trapped within myself, but I will continue to exist, though I live in nightmare now.

Beware!  Beware the Milk!  For the Milk lives.  I too was once tempted by the smooth, sweet creaminess of Tuscan Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 Fl Oz.  I too read the odes written to its greatness, not knowing that the Milk was forcing it's hosts to speak of the goodness of the Milk that the Milk might spread, that it might acquire new hosts in which to live, and to spread, to spread, to spread.

Beware the sweet seduction of the Milk!  Ah - the bittersweet memories of that first gallon.  How smooth, how creamy, how exhilarating, uplifting, fulfilling and enlightening!  How free it made me feel!  But then came that terrible moment when in my home town supermarket, I reached for a gallon of store brand milk, and felt the pain.  Oh, the pain the Milk can give!  Equal in intensity to the first joy that the Milk can give, but pain!  Terrible pain!  Words alone cannot describe it!

And now, I live in fear of the Milk, a Slave to the joy and the pain it can give.  Oh, the shame I feel that I must come to the Milk like a supplicant, begging for the pleasure it can give.  And the cowardice that I feel, knowing that I cannot face the pain it can inflict.

Beware!  Do not let this be your fate!

And now, I must go... the Milk stirs inside me, and it will be angry.  But perhaps, perhaps, it is not too late for you...

Amazon's site made no mention of the products not being in stock, charged my cc, and then mocafe held the order without mentioning that shipment was backordered.  My first call to mocafe received a nebulous response along with an offer to leave a voice mail for someone else, and my second call (upon not receiving a return call) revealed the real facts.  Having a credit card charged for items not in stock is *not* cool.  Beware

How can the vendor justify this kind of pricing? It must be all shipping. Do yourself a favor. Go out of your house and hunt for hot sauces. While it would be too simple to say "they're all the same", there's definitely not a lot of difference within the same manufacturer. I'd get this for a gift for someone, but for myself I'd rather enjoy the hunt.

I am a huge fan of most of the Tasty Bite meals. I'd tried almost all of the Indian flavors and had never been let down. I ordered the Green Curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance. Unfortuantly, I found it to be nearly inedible. The rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just... wrong. I love Thai Green Curry, and this tasted nothing like it. I still recommend the Indian Tasy Bite Meals, but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6.

Don't order a case of these if you've never had them.  I love all the other Haribo gummies I've had (bears, cokes, burgers, etc), but found these weird and didn't enjoy them.  I'm probably just not used to crunchy things on my gummies, but I gave the rest of the case away

This carafe was initially perfect.  The design is attractive and simple, and it fits well in my bag in the mornings.  The problem then began that keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute.  

I attempted to remedy this by cooling my morning coffee or tea in the morning, although I felt this was partially defeating the purpose of bringing in my own coffee or tea.  Then it became an issue that the liquid would either leak or shoot out of the carafe after being turned the slightest direction other than straight up.  I'd suggest saving yourself the trouble and tea stained clothes by buying a different carafe altogether

My daughters (ages 6 and 8) pleaded with me for Tuscan 2% Milk for Christmas.  I ordered two gallons nearly a week ago and they did not arrive on time.  The girls were heartbroken.

And how embarrassing to have to leave a cup of water and cookies for Santa.

I know that American milk has been suffering from quality issues for the past few decades. Many american milks are catching up in initial quality and now have better warranties than foreign milks. Yes, union wages and pensions have driven up the cost of American milk, but hey, we're talking about cows jobs here people! Buy American!

This is Guido Sarduci from the Royal Tuscan Office of Copyrights and Internets and I must insist that you cease any and all sales of theese so called "Tuscan Whole Milks" immediately or I will have to come there and beat you up and then my mom came upstairs and saw me fighting and she got scared and said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air!" I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could said that this cab was rare, but I though "Nah, forget it. Yo home, to Bel Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I said to the cabbie "Yo home, smell ya later!" Looked at my kindom, I was finally there, I could sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.   Love me sum Tuscan

I love salmon and was very excited about having salmon jerky to keep at the office and take camping and skiing... until I got my order and found out that both flavors contain MSG, which gives some people (like me) whopping headaches.  My wife thinks this jerky is okay apart from the processed texture and our dogs love it, but I won't be trying it.  To be fair, you might like this product if you aren't sensitive to MSG, but the seller should have noted that it contains a modern ingredient that causes adverse reactions in some people instead of describing it as being "made the old fashioned way."  On the plus side, shipping was very quick.

I must admit, the first one that I ate was indeed tasty though slightly undercooked.  However, the second one was much less cooked and when I went to cut it, blood from the sausage squirted into my eye.  Now I am beside myself because I remembered my wife going on one night about blood- borne diseases.  I am scared that I might have unwittingly acquired Hepatitus or AIDS.  My wife told me not to worry because the animals the sausages are made from do not carry these diseases.  I refuse to take any chances because my wife and I are having problems.  I still await the results from the blood tests my doctor ordered.

These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.

Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much.

I got a bad batch and was sent another to try out. It was better but still not what I expected. On both, the pieces were very small for some reason. I was looking for some like the ones in MREs, which are excellent. These may be OK for cooking, but not what I wanted. This company's customer service is top notch though

Purchased as a gift to client. The gift basket arrived on time and the recipient commented on how nice the basket was. But one of the cups was chipped. They could not find the chipped piece so we don't know whether or not the break occurred during shipping or not. Either way better care could have been used to insure that the cups are in perfect condition upon arrival. I'm very disappointed especially since this was sent as a gift to an important client. Starbucks coffee and mugs are great corporate gifts but I would choose another company to handle the gift baskets. Will not use them again

I ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy.  There is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound.

Each jelly bean is separately wrapped to make it look like more and when you get in at them they do not taste good.  You are probably used to Jelly Bellies, but these are not Jelly Bellies.  There flavor is medium at best.  I would not buy this product again

Omaha doesn't grade their meat - consequently you don't know if you are purchasing Prime, Choice, Select or worse and from what we have sampled I doubt that it is any better then Select and maybe not that as we've had some skunked steaks

I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.  

After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  It just didn't make sense.  Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.  

My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo.  The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  I always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough.  He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine. 

The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away.  So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.  

Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods.  The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out.  The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried.  So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  But, that has not worked for me.  

So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands.  So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work. 

I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod.  It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  It might be the next thing I try.

Echoing other reviews, performance is not consistant.  One time we did get excellent coffee, this morning it jammed the Senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it.  Considering the price of these pods, even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product

I have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency.  I have wasted two very expensive pods so far.  The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo.  The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far.  I am now afraid to try again.

These steaks are terrific -- but let me tell you, buddy, these people are never going to stop phoning you, once you have bought anything from them.  They repeatedly ask whether you enjoyed your order, and then drop a pitch for you to buy more from them:  AND THEY NEVER STOP CALLING BACK.  Sometimes as often as twice a week, they'll call wanting to sell you more, and this goes on for months and months and months.

Consider yourself duly informed

But just add a little Spenda and cream and it is mmm, mmm, good. I can actually feel a slight boost of energy and think more clearly on the days that I drink this tea. Also, I haven't had the slightest inkling of a cold or flu. This year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and I have been exposed to all of it but, knock on wood, I've been the healthiest one in the family and at work (and the only one drinking this stuff). So go figure? There are too many things good about this tea to not try it

I agree completely with the previous reviewer--this licorice does not even come close to the usual quality of
Haribo candy.  This stuff is dry and hard, and it leaves your hands sticky with waxy grease.  And the flavor--what little there is--is just weird: kind of a fake floral.  NOT recommended

I bought these because I love Haribo gummy products.  However, I was disappointed to see that they are made by Haribo France, i.e. not really German Haribo.  And believe me, there is a HUGE difference.  These ones are very, very greasy, not soft and have almost no strawberry flavor.  Don't waste your money

I purchased this flour a few weeks ago and just baked with it the first time yesterday. I was very satisfied with the taste and texture of it. However, I cannot tolerate gluten or rice and after eating some of what I had baked, I had an allergic reaction. I called the company and they could not tell me anything in regards to their mills nor if there could be any cross-contamination. The lady on the phone seemed to think that the mills are shared equipment and that no precautions are taken to avoid cross-contamination. If you're buying it for low-carb prep only, it should be a good flour at a great deal. Please beware if you are using it to avoid gluten or other allergenic grains

These "steaks" are only distantly related to real Prime Rib.  They are tasteless (other than being overly salted), have a texture reminiscent of congealed soy protein, and look even worse.  Omaha Steaks are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to mail order meats, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere

We have used Kona coffee pods for about a year.  They were excellent.  We found it more convenient to order through Amazon, as the shipment arrived more quickly.  With this last shipment, the coffee often was watery even though the coffee unit was functioning well.  It was hard to know what to do with these various boxes of coffee from from a remote supplier

I have an Indian (American) friend, that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program. She has often made me "yummy/flavorfull" egg sandwiches (i.e. scrambled eggs...)!

I decided to buy some Honeyville & try it? What a disappointment for scrambled eggs (don't know about baking...?)!
1. Their is NO flavor, whatsoever!!!
2. Sticks "hard" to oiled stainless frying pan (fried like a pancake)- Worked better when I mixed in 1tsp of Canola oil, per egg... (like waffles...).

For 1 egg sandwich- I mix 1/4 cup water, to 1/4 cup mix (they say 2-1), which was a runny mess (maybe for baking?).

Limited shelf life...- I store unused mix in the freezer

Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who  can eat just one cup of pasta?
It is very misleading to diabetics as "digestible carbs" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs

The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors, but I didn't get any sweetness at all. I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed.

I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.

However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether. 

The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).

The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes. 

Live and learn, I guess.

I read the other reviews and was greatly excited to order this entree.  I have bought 2-3 varieties of Tasty Bite from my local Trader Joes.  Most are decently healthy and all are easy and fast to make.

Peas and paneer, as an entree, is bland and without any heat/spice.  I am a native Indian so I can handle relatively spicy food.  However, this entree does not merit even a 2-chili rating (out of four).  

As for food quality, I would suggest microwaving the rice and entree separately.  Otherwise, the majority of the sauce seeps into the rice giving it a very unpleasant appearance.  If you boil the pouches (an alternate option), you may have even more success.  However, most of us buy these because of the ease of preparation, so boiling isn't a convenient option.  The rice tastes and looks as it should.

Finally, I do recommend Tasty Bite Entre, Jaipur Vegetables.  I am on box nine of twelve and still not tired.  This entree is MUCH spicier - closer to a 3.25 chili rating (out of four).  I also favor this entree because it doesn't have the throw-away plastic container in each box.  Moreover, you get 12-boxes for a better price than the 6-boxes for the peas and paneer.

I look forward to trying the other Tasty Bites, though I will likely sample the flavors at Trader Joe's before ordering another 6- or 12-box set.  No more Tasty Bite purchases from the Gold Box unless I have already tried that particular flavor - lesson learned

I have been drinking green tea for years, and love not only the taste but the smell too.  When I opened up the box of this tea I thought I was standing over an old ash tray!  It's smells horrid and doesn't infuse well into the water.  I steeped a table spoon of it for five minutes and the water color barely changed.  I highly recommend you NOT buy this tea.  Exotic product aside, the plain old Lipton green tea bags from the grocery store are far better

When  I ordered this "MRE" item, I expected it to be precisely
the same and equal to government-dictated, REAL MRE's being utilized by the U.S. military.  This is NOT the case.  This product is SOPAKCO'S version of whatever they choose to produce & distribute.  I find this false and misleading advertising and can only imagine the millions of suckers like me who have been
caught up in this trickery.  I expected the "real thing," and received a fake.  Very disgusted.  Feel very "used."  Nuts!

Hey, I know a way you can get these practically free of charge, yeah you guessed it, join the service! But really MRE's may have come a long way from the civil war days of hard tack but they still have a long way to go before I'd actually WANT to eat them over a conventionally cooked meal. I guess it's good for emergencies though, or to act like a soldier on a camping trip

But just add a little Spenda and cream and it is mmm, mmm, good. I can actually feel a slight boost of energy and think more clearly on the days that I drink this tea. Also, I haven't had the slightest inkling of a cold or flu. This year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and I have been exposed to all of it but, knock on wood, I've been the healthiest one in the family and at work (and the only one drinking this stuff). So go figure? There are too many things good about this tea to not try it

I like marshmallows, I like them plain in hot cocoa and I like them toasted, and as a fan of jelly beans I tasted this toasted marshmallow flavored jelly bean from Jelly belly and I didn't like this flavor at all. I personally didn't think It really tasted all that much like toasted marshmallows and was just kind of weird tasting

These "steaks" are only distantly related to real Prime Rib.  They are tasteless (other than being overly salted), have a texture reminiscent of congealed soy protein, and look even worse.  Omaha Steaks are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to mail order meats, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere

The prime rib slices I had were pre-cooked and they are terrible. Nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home. They lack in both flavor and texture. The remaining slices I have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos

It's unfortunate that all imported Thai teas seem to have artificial food coloring, and it was a nice idea for Thai Kitchen to try and come up with an all-natural analog.  However, this tastes nothing like real Thai tea.  They need to take this one back to the test kitchen

I'll admit it. The first three or so Cheetos actually taste pretty good. However, each one seems to taste worse, for some reason. And then there's the despicable Cheeto dust... You get that stuff on your fingers, and you're forced to either wipe it on something, (gross) or thoroughly lick it off your fingers (gross). I detest snacks with sticky dust crap. This stuff is the worst offender

Kashmir Spinach is the third Tasty Bite offering I have tried.  
The look and taste is quite unappealing.  
We would not consider buying it again.  
We had high hopes based on how much we loved other Tasty Bite items we tried, but no luck with this one.

I encourage you to try Agra Peas or Jaipur Vegetables instead, two Tasty Bite items that are really fantastic

This has the overwhelming acidic taste that is characteristic of canned spinach, that frozen and fresh don't have. If you know what I'm talking about and like that taste, then this is OK, but for us it's inedible

The description for this item is not accurate. I bought the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great. However, these are dehydrated which means 2 important things:
- Texture: these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water. Don't think about adding these to cereal, only for trail mix or eating out of hand.
- Saturated fat: the second ingredient is coconut oil! One 2oz. serving has 190 calories, 19 grams of fat and 16 grams of saturated fat. You're better off eating Cheetos.

These are extremely unhealthy and don't even taste that great. There is (unsurprisingly) and oily aftertaste. Buyer beware. Stick to purely freeze dried fruits - nothing is added and they are healthy

Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.5g.  Would you believe that in 0.5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate!?  No way!!

The sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate, but since it's 600x as sweet as sugar, they need to bulk it up to make it measure like sugar. But all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates.

This could really screw up somebody on Atkins' Induction phase.  For example, the day before I learned this, I made some Kool-Aid with Splenda.  I didn't know that in 2 quarts I was drinking down 24 carbs!

What to do?  Find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose.  They use water as the filler, it's super-concentrated still, and it truly has 0 carbs.  I look forward to the day when McNeil Nutritionals meets the demand for ZERO-carb Splenda.  (That's 0.0g, not 0.49g!

Well, I guess I'm the fly in this reviewer ointment, but Dave's is the only hotsauce that I won't buy. It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non-existent. This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers. It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion. According to Wikipedia, its Scoville heat (fire) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco's 2,500 to 5,000 rating. Who needs that much heat? Not me or most human beings. This stuff is lethal. No thanks.

The sweet taste was excessive and unpleasant.  I thought it was not fresh tasting.  The picture is deceiving because each fruit is cut in half and you get the top half only.  Other Marzipan is the entire round shape of the fruit. I am glad that I only bought the small size since I ended up throwing this purchase in the trash

I expected something better from Godiva Chocolatier.

I am a big fan of both chocolates and coffe, but

Godiva seems to be making coffee that tastes like something

in between vanilla and chocolate.

I could endure chocolate creme and vanilla hazelnut, but 

this creme brulee coffee is just awful.

Godiva has to focus on their chocolates.

True coffee-lovers/connoisseurs will hate this coffee

I ordered a few boxes of this and I couldn't stomach this.  The spices were very off in this type of dish, to the point where it made it couldn't stand the taste of it.  It had way too much cinnamon.  I ended up throwning my other boxes out.  I would recommend Kohinoor brand over this any day.

This product is overpriced.  I found 11 oz. bags of this at the local grocery store for $3.49, which is 31.7 cents/oz.  This gives $12.22 for the 38.5 oz. bag featured here.  And there ordinarily would be a further discount for buying it in a larger size bag.  The candy is good, but it seems better to look for it in your local store

I loved the plain ones, they were round but had a scallopped edge to them with a hole in the center.

These are thin solid and dark patties that cook up tasteless, juiceless and unburgerlike in texture.  Completely unlike their advertising and unlike the regular beef patties sold at the supermarket.  I will never buy Omaha Steak products again.

Omaha Steaks' customer representatives are very nice however.  I wrote to them telling them about my experience and they said I could dump the scary meat and they would credit my card.  Thank you very much.

I placed an order for these beans on March 4th. On the 14th march, I did not receive them as yet. Since the occasion that I needed them for has passed, I sent an email to JR to find out the problem. When he said they were not shipped as yet, I send 2 e-mails requesting cancellation-i sent 2 to make sure they got it and stopped the mailing of my item!
He responded VERY hastily, as used sarcastic comments in his reply.The tone of his reply made me feel as if I did not know anything!!

 I am very disappointed with this whole ordeal!

This cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste.  The dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter.  We don't care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either.  The chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors, but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa "tasted strange".  There are many non-gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother, more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand.  We won't buy this cocoa again.  This gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets. But the cocoa fails the taste test.

As I said above, the "vanilla" you'll get is artificial; it's Vanillin, not the way more expensive Vanilla being advertised.  Personally, I don't care for Vanillin, because it tastes harsh and chemical-laden to me.  This stuff tastes no different than the fake vanilla at the supermarket, and I didn't have to trouble my poor mailman into delivering it

The product that I received is partly vanillin, an artificial vanilla.  I expected to get PURE mexican vanilla.  Naturally I was disappointed

These were just awful!  We tried to give them away, but after one taste not one person liked them.  I wish I could explain the flavor so anyone reading this could decide, but there is nothing to describe it.  We ended up throwing them out

This is what happens when Starbucks destroys a good brand to elevate its lousy brand.  This blend is undrinkable.  Save your money and buy a supermarket brand.

Not very exciting...cake part actually tasted a bit stale.  They just didn't seem very special...sorta like commercial snake cakes.  At 50 cents a cake/bite, not worth it.  At least they were pretty

I am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping.  The product costs $29.95, and shipping is $22.49 ... Doubling the cost!

This is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater I worked in during high school.  I adore it

When I received the item the box was busted open and all the cookies in both packages were crushed up.  One of the packages was open and leaking cookies dust all over my car when I pulled it out of the mailing box.  On top of that the one or two cookies that were salvaged were stale!  Ill never order anything from this company again!!!  My entire $11.00 went down the tubes.  What a waste!!!

Beware----The Cadbury from Netgrocer's is not the creamy UK Cadbury.  It the Hershey Cadbury from the US.  The difference between the two is like the difference between a Miller and a fresh Guiness

I couldn't believe the price for these berries, and they're a third of the size they should be.  I'll stick to buying mine from the local Asian foods grocery at $3.25 a pound

Fun idea.. really, really fun idea.  

However, I gave each of my teenagers (11 & 14),  a Reindeer Jelly Bean Candy Pooper.  It was some task for the kids (and the rest of the family) to get the dam things out of the packaging w/o breaking them.    The first one lost it's rear legs before getting all the way out of the package.  woof!  The second one stay together long enough to see the new year.  TIP use a razor blade and be careful of the legs
