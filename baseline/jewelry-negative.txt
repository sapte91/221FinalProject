 I bought this watch for my husband, but didn't take the time to read the description carefully.  So it's my fault I had to send it back. He is in the Army and leaving soon for Iraq.  I thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift.  Unfortunately it does not work if you're more than 2,000 miles from Colorado. If you are not going to leave the continental United States I suppose it would be a good watch

These earrings were very uncomfortable.  I'm not sure if it's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle--more like an angled bar than a round post.  I don't have particularly sensitive ears, although I generally don't wear large or heavy jewelry, either.  These earrings are on their way back to Amazon.

I also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied.  When I ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99.  Some reviewers bought them for less, yet the current price seems to be even more.

Caveat Emptor

I was very disappointed in these earrings.  They were only about the size of a nickel, and for $50 I expected them to be as large as earrings I have found from several other merchants for the same price.  If you are looking for average size hoops -- say the size of a quarter -- these are NOT the earrings for you.  I can only imagine how tiny the $30 pair is

My 5-year-old daughter was thrilled with her locket. It is really beautiful. We were both quite disappointed, however, when the locket itself broke...the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off. She is a normal kid, but was not overly rough with the necklace. It is currently at the jeweler's to be fixed

We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other.  This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it.  Also, the locket is very, very hard to open.  The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed.  Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn

The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money.

These were nice earings, which I received as a gift off my wish list.  But after I wore them about 3 or 4 times, one of them fell out and is now lost.  The post does not stay in place very well.  I am frustrated because I put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an "innovative clasp" which avoids lost earings.  But they did not work well for me.    
By the way, after I first wrote this review, I called Amazon to complain.  They sent me another pair right away at no charge.  This suggests to me that others have complained in the past.  I appreciate that they were so responive.

This is way too small for a men's watch, both the face and the band -- the band wouldn't even go around my wrist.  I think this must be a women's watch mislabled.  Nice looking, but I sure can't use it -- I'm going to have to return it

I bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews. I thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches, rather than paying $10 each time to have a professional do it. I was so disappointed in this tool. The link remover only pushes the pins out halfway. You are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way. As you can imagine this is not easy. My husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out. Knowing what I know now, I would definitely have invested in a different link remover

The product pretty much snapped in half while I was trying to remove two links from one watch.  The other one I tried before this one didn't fit in the adjustment piece at all.  So with that said, do not buy this product at all.  It's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use.  Instructions are very unclear.  I ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed

This supposedly "new" item looked like it had been either used a few times or someone had left it out in the rain.  It arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool.  The silver knob that you can see on the left side of this "tool" was rusted and would not turn very easily.  I'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins.  Maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item.  When I attempted to use it, the entire plastic body would flex and I was afraid that it would snap if I twisted the knob any further.  Not worth the sale price that it was advertised.  The most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins.  This is definitely not worth the sale price

I had loved it at first, but I am one to leave a necklace on forever. It started to get all kinked up and I couldn't figure out how to straighten it out. But the company did offer me a discount on a different chain, even though it was past their 30 day policy. Nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it

for $10 these were too good to pass up.  First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece.  First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.   

This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine.  Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping   (or a different supplier?)

Though the design is cool, the quality of this pendant is poor.  They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper.  They look like toys!  I also bought the earrings set with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both.  :-(  Only the packaging is of good quality in this product.

I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design.

Though evenly matched, the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image. Both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these aren't apparent if you are wearing them. About the quality you'd expect from Mervyn's or Sears on sale. Not terrible, but not great

The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products

There two major problems with this watch. One, Auto-atomic setting do not work as described in manual. Second, Unable to even set time using good old fashion manual way. Returned to Casio for repair, hope they get it right

If you check out the page you find this "womens" watch for $133.99 you will also find the "mens" version for just $98.00. Why would this be? If anthing because of the gold plating and the mens watch being much larger, it would cost more to make the mens watch. More size, more gold, more gold, higher price to make. Another little thing that bothers me is both watches are shown together with a little "better together" hook. Better for who? There is not once cent in discount for buying together.

I own an Invicta and have had no trouble with it. I would buy the pair for my wife and I. But, I am not going to toss out an extra $35.99 for the womens watch just because Invicta and/or amazon feel they can charge more for if anything a product that would not cost as much to make.

Man, it seems that the women would really get hot over this

Fair warning--had I had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company's watches, I never would have bought one.  Do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money.  The percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low

I was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for Christmas, however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented.  Now I need to return them.  Other than the dent, they were cute. Even though they were only $25.00, there should be some quality control by the manufacturer

I love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. But I really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because I bought it for the whole package (chain included). So when I got it I was SHOCKED that it didn't included it. So buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad.

I purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch.  However, it never worked.  I don't know if it had a dead battery or if it's broken.  The cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as I paid for the watch.  I will try to resolve the issue with Amazon

The earrings are nice & a great value at $30. However, the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore. The posts are not the typical size one might find in US stores. The posts are more typical of earrings that I have purchased in Central & Southern America; in fact, this is where the earrings were made. I returned them

This ring does NOT look as pictured.  It arrived today (almost 3 weeks after I ordered it) and is extremely thin, has tarnish marks, and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places.  It looks like it came out of a vending machine and I'm obviously pretty disappointed.  I won't be buying anything from this vendor again

This bracelet is silver TONED, not sterling silver. The embossing is also not the greatest - clear on the one side, but hard to see the letters on the other

 First of all I would like to mention that the Invicta brand,that exists and produces watches nowadays,has nothing to do with the Swiss company that bears the same name,but went into bankruptcy a few decades ago.The actual Invicta company is an american one and has bought the rights to use this name.
 The mechanisms are Swiss made or made in Japan.About the ones made in Switzerland I cannot post an opinion.This particular model(9211),which I purchased this year,has a japanese mechanism(Made by Myota I think).Every 24 hours it loses some precious seconds,so,after a few days it becomes a matter of minutes.In conclusion it has a problem with precision,beeing unable to keep time with accuracy.
 I would advise anyone who wants to buy this watch to think twice.Of course the discount price is attractive but the watch doesn't meet it's expectasions;I consider that a "minimum" dose of accuracy is required.The only good aspect about this watch is it's appearance.
 Learn from other's mistakes...

This watch looks good but the movement is terrible. I got this watch as a Christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand. I must warn you, if you purchase this watch then don't be suprised if it doesn't work right. It may look like a Rolex but it doesn't work like one

The clip holds the money, but the credit card holder is a bit scary.  It just doesn't work that well.  Plus, it is very heavy.  If you put 5 bills in there, even without the credit cards, this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket.  I would not recommend it

As title says.  There were kind of a "water mark" on the face of the watch, maybe a leak from the solar panel?  I did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch, no point paying shipping back and forth.
Anyways the instructions were easy to understand, buttons on the side a little bit hard to push.  Blue LED on red face looks bad, because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see.  This watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust, I am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail

This watch was a disappointment; it has a huge dial, but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny.  It's also an extremely "flashy" watch - the image on the web-site makes it look classy - not so.  Additionally, the watch is completely useless under low light conditions - it neither fluoresces, nor does it have a light-up function.  Returned it after a week, got my money back

Nice looking but with very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw - after LESS THAN 2 month of use in office environment glass CRACKED WITHOUT ANY IMPACT whatsoever. Now I'll have to find out if Skagen's customer service is any good. For $70 watch I certainly expected better quality.
After reading other reviews for this models I realized that many other people had the same issue. 
BOTTOM LINE -AVOID!!

These diamonds shouldn't be offered in this size for jewelry.  The imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for.  Great price - but you get what you pay for

I bought these for my young daughter. I understood the basics of diamond ratings and wasn't concerned with the inclusions they may have contained. I expected low quality stones with some particles visable to the naked eye. What i didn't expect was the cloudiness. Although these weren't yellow in color they were the absolute worst pair of diamonds i had ever seen. There was  no clarity just two milky looking stones. These diamonds should have been grinded and used for diamond dust or chips only

I can see why they are priced so low, I figured that they would look like the photo, or something like it but the ones I received are very cloudy.  I guess you get what you are paying for.  As for the K clarity, I have no idea what that is so I never thought they would look this bad

By the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund. Not happ

As per the review, I decided to buy the item. I received it. It was very thick and ugly looking. It just looks good in the picture. As mentioned by someone, it has plastic back cover which makes it worse. It also is very large and long. So to remove the small braces cost more. Overall unhappy and returned to AMAZON with loss of money in shipping

It was larger than I expected from the images, thicker too. In my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe.

I was very disappointed that the regular second hand was NOT in fact the large sweeping thin hand, that's actually only for the stop watch. The regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle.

Really, with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which, and the cheaper look of the watch in person, I never actually put it on before sending it back

These were on my mom's wishlist, so I bought them.  They just arrived and I'm totally disappointed.  I'd return them if it wouldn't cost me and I wasn't so lazy.  

They look pretty darn cheap, for starters.  Also, they came in a little, plastic zipper bag inside of a little, pseudo-velour bag, with a price tag for $3.30 on it.

Save your money.  It's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen

The Topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth $45, but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page. The shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5/16" long; the larger stone is about 3/16" wide and 1/4" high; the small stone is about 3/32" wide. Essentially, you get what you pay for

I bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch.  The v-notched end was too thick to fit - I used my pocket knife instead.  Maybe there's a "knack" to it, but I didn't want to scratch my watch while practicing.
The pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small, recessed auto-set buttons for which a ball-point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy. But you probably have something around the house that would work just as well (mini-screwdriver, the point of a phillips head...

I was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is.  I don't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not, or if they were and I just didn't see or pay attention to them, but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it's meant for a very young child.  The necklace may be 18", but the pendant itself was so small, not at all what I was looking for.  So i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece.  What I was really wanting was a larger, heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult.  Never have found one yet.

My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace.  Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item.  As they say, "you get what you pay for!

I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler. I did that, buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right. I've read the manual over and over. My sons did the same. It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it

I got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch.  After wearing Invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist.

When I received it, I noticed the small scratches all over the crystal.  Nothing deep, but they really pick up the glare. 

Atomic signal, I am unable to get it to pick up one.  In Memphis, TN, I think I should be in range, and all my atomic clocks sync up fine.  I have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house.  Still no good.

Basically I spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight.  Lesson learned

I bought these for my mom, she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online, when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment.

The entire earring is tiny, the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver, from not very far away at all, they just look like a gray blob, very hard to tell what shape. Not impressed, I suggest you look for something else.

I will be returning these immediatel

Here is an example of the deception of photos on the net. The smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product!!
We had to put them on our 9 month old grandaughter, and even then they still appeared tiny on her baby ears!! Rip off, never buy jewlery from amazon again!

I have owned several timex ironman watches over the years. Loved 'em all. I don't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery, or if it's a flaw in the watch. However, when punching through the modes, everything is REALLY SLOW. If I go to alarm, I have to wait a few seconds for it to appear, then wait a few more when I choose to modify it. Not quick an easy like my other ironmans. Great features though, if it wasn't for this annoying delay, 5 stars easy.
So I don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. Either way, it is a problem that dropped the score for me

It might just be REALLY bad luck, but after three fossil watches (1 x blue, 2 x titanium), I've never managed to make them last more than two years each. They are really cool, look great and the price is reasonable. But this is the third time Fossil lets me down. And to get them repaired through the warranty is extremely painful.

This time I'm looking for another brand as I feel I'm wasting my money

"I bought this watch as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, after 2 weeks, the round thing on top of the watch came off. 
The seller says it has to be sent to repair..and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back. I am so embarassed of the poor quality gift I chose and can't belive they will not replace it ..with an apology...their answer is just not acceptable."
But there is nothing else I can do but write this review, I have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews I read I was happy with the gift..but now ...I am so disapointe

I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund

This watch stinks.  Crappy manual, the band is so big it could fit around my leg, and when I received it, IT DIDN'T WORK.  Now I have to pay extra to fix the band AND to get it working.  So much for what I thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch. I would've given it no stars if I could. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID - AVOID THIS WATCH

I work in a bank where every year each of the branches does a stupid secret Santa thing around Christmas time.  I bought this as a gift for the guy I got stuck with.  

The thing comes in a nondescript box and looks like a paper clip.  If I had given this as a gift, people would have thought I raided the supply closet at work for a present.  Total garbage

I got the watches as party favors for my 10year old party guests, but none of the kids or I have been able to reset it. My daughter has been frustrated with it and says some of her friends she inquired from had the same issue with the watch. The 2 little knobs can't be manipulated as indicated on the accompanying  instruction sheet. Needless to say the watches are beautiful and attractive, but if kids for whom they were made can not reset them and use  them then the purpose is defeated. The service was great, but  the product is unsatisfactory.

I love the size (small) and quality of these earrings that were ordered for my 6 year old.  The website picture shows them as a blue and purple color.  When I got them they were pink and green, even the replacements they sent were pink and green.  I have not been happy with their customer service on these and will not order jewelry again.

I bought this for my daughter. The display was dead when it arrived. I took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery, and the live battery let some display show, but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used. My daughter found a much cheaper watch at Target, with more features (a stopwatch!).  This one wasn't even worth sending back

I bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart.  The bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled.  Poor quality, I am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring, or the fragile nature of the metal.  I wish I had my 25 bucks back

I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring.  We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless.

I didn't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before I purchased the watch~ this is Disney and Tinker Bell!. The word "Flirt" didn't bother me either because Tinkerbell was a flirt.   Wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band I was shocked that this watch is under the children's section. I needed this for my grand daughter's birthday. Like it was said before, I could have given this five stars but HOT and Saucy for a young girl, oh no

To much trouble to send back, but arrived with a dead battery.
Ended up getting another gift and still carry watch around in trunk to get a battery put in it. Watch looks nice - but it would be nice if it worked

Having read the other reviews I expected something small, but decent.  The particular pair I received had two defects: 1. one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2. one of the stones had a very large, visible black inclusion near the top.  It was visible to my naked eye (I don't have a jeweler's loupe) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts.  Maybe I just got a bad pair, but given those two problems and the small size of the stones, I sent them back and did not try again.

I bought these for my wife for Christmas 2005. By August 2006 one of them fell apart. The gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld, which broke. It was not due to any abnormally rough handling. It would have cost $50.00 to have repaired. Now they're throw-aways

I was extrememly unhappy with this necklace.  The picture on-line makes it look beautiful with light shining thru the amethyst (ha, looks like cut glass not real amethyst!)/Even putting it up to the natural light it looked dull/fake/plastic.  I emailed and got a reply I would get a full discount just mail it back.  Well, I mailed it back with insurance costing $6.55 after already paying shipping to have it sent to me.  Because I feel it was NOT advertised in a 'correct light' I asked for my shipping back for both charges and disputed the charge with my credit card company.  The refund from Amazon was only the cost of the necklace with neither shipping charge.  I am still going to dispute the the shipping charges because this jewelry did NOT look like it did on the website

LOOKED GOOD ON ME THIS WATCH BUT I FOUND OUT JUST IN TIME THAT THIS DID NOT CARRY SEIKO'S REGULAR TWO OR THREE YEAR WARRANTY SINCE IT IS A GREY MARKET WATCH. HAVING READ THE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SEIKO MONSTER I DECIDED I NEEDED A WARRANTY. SO FOR THIS SIMPLE REASON I HAD TO RETURN IT TO AMAZON RIGHT AWAY AND AM IN THE PROCESS OF EXCHNAGING IT WITH ANOTHER BRAND THAT DOES HAVE WARRANTY.

When I first got this watch I was thrilled.  It has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination.  The problem started when I went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists.  The guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market, because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing.  At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store.  As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart.  What a piece of junk!  I regret buying this watch and I advise against it.

Very disappointed in the watch and Amazon. The day/date did not work on delivery but I was unaware of it until the end of February when I tried to manually change the date. I found that it was broken at that time, about a week after I received the watch. The day/date did change automatically each night. Amazon refused t orepalce it because I had the band adjusted. Seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3-4 weeks! Had I purchased it from a REPUTABLE local store I could have exchanged it for a new watch.

I DIDN T KNOW THESE WATCHES WERE MADE IN SINGAPORE. MAYBE THIS IS WHY MY " MONSTER" DOESN T WORK. WHO KNOWS ,,,,,,,TOKE TO AUTHURIZED DEALER FOR REPAIR . HE WANTED $ 175.   DONT BUY SEIKO,,,,,,,

Pardon me if I also wish to review anonymously. I now can come forward with my negative experience with the Seiko Black Monster too after seeing a handful of other ex-owners post theirs. I had my Seiko Black Monster SKX779K1 for about three weeks when it also did a freeze of all its movements and sounds. No sweep motion, no tick-tock of any sort. But unlike someone else's experience, mine never sprang to life anymore. AFter I shook it gently sideways to wind it up, its second hand moved for only about 10-12 seconds then stopped again. I did this "Watch CPR" several times but still always failed to resucitate it. My watch also was forming a light miss on the inside of its crystal a day after I used in while doing the dishes of all things. This is a divers watch? I already packed it up last Thursday for return and dropped it off at my local USPS, and Im still thinking whether to give it a chance and get another Black Monster or to get an entirely different model or brand. I must day that I am DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME in this watch! I loved the way it looked and it really made me felt bad to return it. But to me a watch is an instrument first, an accessory only second.

I orginally purchased this for myself when it was $10.  As soon as I received it I went to put it on and it broke right away.  I was very disappointed so my boyfriend purchased another one for me for $10.  I went to put that one on and it broke as well.  I was never able to wear the necklace even once.  I do not recommend this product to anyone!!!!!

Okay, I may be picky, but these earrings are just too thin!  I get the idea of delicate, sparkly things, but these don't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial.  They are pretty and sparkly, but the crystal looks like all I could afford was a thin slice.  The picture also makes the crystals appear blue-ish, but mine are more of a yellow-ish tint.  Not what I expected

Recieved my Orange Monster Last September. I have worn it every day. I like the look and design of this watch but unfortunatly this watch does not keep very accurate time. Often losing about five minutes a week. I have friends who also own the Black Monster and anonther Orange monster and they have the same complaint. 

If I was to buy another watch I would not buy this Seiko again

I share my bad experience with Seiko Monster and some say Im stirring up trouble. Hey, we're in a democracy when I last checked. Duh.  Yeah maybe I am spreading the word about my faulty Seiko Monster but that's the TRUTH and I want others to know that my Seiko Monster was defective. At least Im not a dumb fanatic Seiko Monster cultist who idolizes this watch with a candle-lit shrine, chants, and ritual. For crying out loud, it's just a watch, an inanimate spiritless object, that does not have feelings or civil rights! But it did hurt that I wasted $150 for this bad watch. I dont care about giving the watch a chance, regulating, breaking it in, etc. What happened to my Seiko Monster is that it stopped, which is not good, so I returned for an exchange.

This thing is miniscule. It barely fits on my (petite) seven year old's neck. Although the size is mentioned in the description, the picture is misleading - the pendant itself is *smaller* than the image on the screen - and I consider that borderline false advertising.

I should have been a more aware buyer, so this review isn't to say the product is bad, just be aware of how small it is - my daughter couldn't even find it in the bag when I gave it to her, it was so small she thought I'd bought her an empty bag

 you can't use this watch opener alone. You need a vise to hold the watch. The gromets that go into the opener that are supposed to fit into the watch back grooves do not stay in. As soon as you turn it over they fall out. I've already lost two of them. It's a poorly made item, and if it woldn't cost about as much to return it as keep it I would return it

loved how quiet it runs, have one double the price and twice the noise! only one problem, the bottom turn table stopped within the first week!! yet the top turn table kept working. contacted amazon and they secured a return.  only problem cost $11.00 to return. seems the quality control needs improving

I bought this winder for my husband because of the price. But it is so loud!!!!  We had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.

I'm in the military,  It hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas.  It's always been easy to order from Amazon as always, I never had any problems.  the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings, when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear, the post broke off from the ball earring.  I only had them for two weeks

I liked the watch. I had to send the first one back because the date would never change. I got the second one a month ago and haven't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash. Nice looking watch. Too bad I have to carry it around in my pocket now

I am very dissapointed with the band on this watch. The band absorbs and holds moisture. The last thing I want while exercising is a sopping wet watch band around my wrist. This could cause irration and a rash. WHAT WAS THE DESIGNER THINKING? Moreover, even when dry the band is rough to the skin and not comfortable to wear.

I have liked Timex watches and felt the company was innovative and thoughtful in its watch designs. This watch band is neither innovative nor thoughtful in its design. 

I don't even want to wear this watch. I really don't think I should have to buy a new watch band for my brand new watch.

Furthermore, Timex customer service is like dealing with a bunch of idiots. It is as if they read about 2 words of your email and then reply. I guess they think that if they keep feeding you stupid answers long enough, you'll eventually go awa

Big plus was the large digits on display: I'm short-sighted and run without my specs, so I needed that. The feel of the watch is nice. However, one big problem with it was that moving my wrist around kept poking the buttons and changing the display without warning (maybe because I have big wrists). Bigger problem yet: it took all of about 4 months for the plastic strap to break

There aren't any colors in this pendant, just a ugly topaz which ruins the pendant, same happened with heart I ordered from this seller. Normal Swarovski crystals do NOT have a Topaz covering the beauty of the crystals. Sorry I wasted my money, should have bought from Swarovski site

Come on!  I thought they had erroneously mailed out CZs!  These earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them!  What a RIP!   The sterling silver was nice and well-constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones.  Quite a disappointment!  I had to buy an emergency back-up Christmas gift for my best friend

Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings.

In my case, I bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee. When I first received it today, I was really liked the "design" of the earring.  But after closer examination, I noticed that the "blue" stone was "very light blue". Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your "own" eyes and not through fancy "photoshop" website with touchup/enhanced photos

Amendment to below review (Mar 07):  My wife really likes them and wears them all the time.  I'd upgrade at least one more star, maybe two if I could.
----------------------------------------------------------

My son wanted to buy mama's present this Christmas so naturally, we turned to Amazon for computer skill training and the ability to view a lot of products easily.  

The earrings arrived today (very quickly) but the stone is not nearly as robust as the picture depicts.  The stone is white, like a fake diamond.  When viewed in other kinds of light, you can see a slight tint of blue but nothing like the picture.  

Another issue - the clasp or ear stud is flimsy.  I may return them (need to ask my son) but I don't think these earrings will last more than a couple of wears.

On the positive side - it really is a nice design

This was a present to myself for my birthday.  I thought I was purchasing a quality product.  Two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working.  I took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again.  I sent it back for a refund and not very happy I have to pay a restock fee for a defective item.  I will be rethinking future purchases...

I don't know who's running the show at Amazon, but thier packing is atrocious... they packed this watch with only a single air bubble. of course when I received it it fell out of its tin, and was scratched... be wary of buying anything from amazon in regards to precious jewelry..... watch was fine though, so if you really want this item, purchase it somewhere else

Croton makes very superficial products - they look good on the shelf, but are very poorly constructed.  Once you get them home they start to fall apart.

They have no customer service at all.  Nobody answers the phone or returns email.  Before buying a Croton watch - call their customer service.  You won't get through

I am very disappointed with this ring.  It is very pretty, but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together.  My husband and I have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had NO luck.  Now all I have is a pile of silver rings that I cannot wear.  If anyone knows how to put this back together, please post how!  Thanks

The diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits.  As a result, the diamonds are dark in color and don't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid.  I'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago.  I do not recommend purchasing from this company if you're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye

The chain was MUCH thicker than I expected. And it's pretty obvious that it isn't real silver. But, if you want some cheap metal bling, this will do it.

I received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch.  Unfortunately the crown wouldn't pull out (to set the date/time) so I returned it immediately.  Fortunately, Amazon's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping (either way) for broken items.  I'll probably try again with another Invicta from Amazon

I loved these earrings, and at the price, I thought they'd be great. However, when I got them, I quickly discovered that the back for one of the pair was too loose to actually stay on the earring. Within two days, the earring had fallen out and I have yet to find it. There $15 down the drain

The packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale, nice black leather case, MUCH nicer than the bracelet deserved, however.
The bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap. It is not rounded as pictured, but flat like a dog tag (only much smaller). I'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but I would never wear it by itself. I understand though that it is NOT an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for .925 silver at that price

These watches sounded like a good deal, given the original price.  I ordered two, one for myself and one for my brother.  They arrived today and both could not be set.  That is, the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out.  They were both stuck in the case so tight I broke a nail in the attempt.  And I agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless.  They go back tomorrow

I was very disappointed in this purchase, and eventually ended up returning it.  The actual product did not live up to my expectation.  While the cross was of average quality (not great, but OK), the chain was very cheaply made.  It did not even have a clasp on it -- you had to pull it over your head to get it on.  The price of this item did not match the quality of the product, by any means.  Even though I was disappointed with the item, I have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund.  Their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back, no questions asked.

I have purchased eight of these units over the past year. Two of the eight have stopped working altogether, and this morning one of the turntables on a third unit now fails to revolve. The seller replaced the first unit that failed,  and when I requested replacement of the second unit, I was told that it has been replaced by a newer model with vertical stacking and more timing features. They could not offer the new model to me in exchange, but they did offer a $20 discount.  It arrived today and seems to be working well. If you are considering purchasing any  unit made by this manufacturer (Garnin), consider it as suitable for short term use, rather than long term usage

Skagen Watch Problem - Don't Buy Their Watches-Crystals Crack

I would rate this zero stars but the system will not allow me to do this - hence the one star.I bought this watch for my wife as a 2006 Christmas present. The crystal subsequently cracked due to temperature changes. The elegant design of a thin gold rim holding the crystal cannot stand large rapid temperature differences. I went to my local jeweler who was very familiar with the crystal issue with Skagen watches. I called Skagen, seems they are aware of this problem too. However the only option offered was to send the watch back for repair -pay $25.00 for repair of the crystal, pay $8.95 for s&h and then pay insurance and return postage. As I paid $65.00 for the watch I consider this a total ripoff. I would not buy another product from Skagen and recommend that Amazon discontinue selling any Skagen products until they become a responsible corporate partner. It is a pretty watch and seemed like a good deal - but it is not turning out that way. Or you can buy this watch and only wera it in warm climates

the watch is beautiful, graceful, even elegant...BUT the clasp is designed by a designer who likes complexity. this has, as do all of the mesh bands, has the clasp from HELL!!!

out of the box, it needed a manual to figure out...this the first warning sign. setting up to the wrist size was awkward and hard to do. then putting the watch on and hooking one mechanism over some rod is very hard, then there are more steps, each one a real challenge. then when i took my watch off, i must have pulled the wrong lever and zip the watch feel groundward. happy to say it ended up on the bed, for had it gone to the hard floor, i may be looking at a new crystal buying experience.

an older person with hands no longer working well will find this watch impossible to put on and take off.

i could never ever recommend this watch, not for it's looks, but just for the band and clasp...foolish foolish person who designed it

I understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set. When the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet. It was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking. The neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws, Yeach..

The watch winder is very quiet and inexpensive.  However, the quality is suspect - one side stopped rotating after a week.  You probably get what you pay for. Too much hassle and does not make economic sense to ship back and incur international shipping charges

I've owned a fairly heavy Seiko Kinetic for several years and recently had it repaired when it began having trouble holding a charge. To avoid problems with my reenergized time piece, I decided to invest in a winder.  After comparing online prices and reading dozens of reviews, I thought I had found a reasonably priced solution to keep my Seiko moving.  This winder does everything it's supposed to do (spin, stop, reverse, etc.) but can't provide sufficient motion to activate the charging mechanism inside my heavyweight watch.  Unfortunately, my kinetic may have made it's final sweep around the dial.  On the bright side, I now have a winder that I can only hope does a better job with my NEXT automatic watch

Bought this for our 20 year old son for x-mas.  I was very disappointed with the quality of this $85 pendant and returned it the very next day.  The chain looked and felt like plastic.  My initial reaction when I took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine.

Went to a Christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for $28 that was 1,000 times better than this $85 one

I had this heart rate monitor for 7 days.  The first couple of days it worked fine then it just stopped transmitting.  I tried everything and it just did not work.  The watch itself was fine.  I ended up sending it back and paying the little bit extra for a polar.

My wife received this heart rate monitor from me for Christmas 2005. First my wife, them my father in law and then finally I have been unable to get the chest strap to begin transmitting to the wrist watch. We have read the documentation and looked at the Timex web page without success so far. It is now January 2nd and I still cannot get it working. I may change my review later if I find this is all due to operator error, but at this point three well educated people have been unable to figure it out. At the very least there is a problem with either ease of use or documentation. 

In the Fitness Sensor User Guide there are pieces listed that are not in my box. However, the web page does not mention them. I suspect the guide is an older version. If not, perhaps there has been a shipping error. In any case, I am not happy.

I placed my order with little time to spare before Valentine's Day. Amazon delivered the item is a timely fashion as usual!! However, to my disappointment, when I opened the box the item came in... it looked TERRIBLE. I though the price was a steal, but feel as if I paid way too much for what was received. 

I would not recommend purchasing the item unless you intend to give it to someone who doesn't understand jewelry. Give it to someone for their 10th birthday and you'll find at least 1 smile in the room. 

I have all intentions on returning this item for a refund as I'd feel a little embarrassed giving this as Valentine's Day gift (unless it was for my grandmother).

The picture provided is very disceaving. This product could very well come packaged as a free prize in a box of Lucky Charms. I was planning on giving this to my girlfriend as a gift but was far too ashamed. Stay away, move onto a different product. I will be returning ASAP

The picture and description is not at all what you get. It is tiny, looks cheap and I was ashamed of bieng taken of advantage of. One expects better quality from Amazon. Do not buy ..go to a reputable jewelr. Amazon should stick to selling books

my wife wanted us to get exact watches for valentine's day and she saw this watches that look nice and trendy and had a good price.
So we decided to get 2 MENS LUCIEN PICCARD AUTOMATIC 3 EYE DATE WATCH 26570BU,in a matter of a week we got the watches but one of them came with the days hand off and some screws of the mechaninal part in the back were loose and you could see them thou the clear back the watch came with,lucky for us the other was intact.I understand that although the watch looks nice it's much too fragile even for the price since i owned a lot of cheap watches( casio,swatch,pulsar,etc..)and they are not this fragile.

I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and when his mother was taking it out of the box, the clasp broke and it's not repairable.  Apparently it's attached to the box with staples and unless you have a staple pulled, it's too fragile to just pull from the holder.

I made this purchase in Oct has a X-mas gift.  They arrived and at quick glance appeared to be fine.  I immediately wrapped the earrings and they were hidden away.  X-mas morning after my young daughter open her gift I more closely examined them.  One of the earrings was completely grayish in color; so dark that I would consider it to be defective.  I called the Netaya customer service phone number only to be greeted with "Hello".  After verifying that I had indeed reached Netaya I briefly explained the defect and requested that I be permitted to return the earrings.  I was placed on hold and then told that "the lady" I needed to speak with was busy and I would need to call back or send an e-mail.  I e-mailed the company twice before receiving notice that they would not accept the return because 30 days had passed since purchase.  I would not recommend

This watch is a good size, pretty comfortable, and nice looking for a sport watch. But resetting time or date, or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake (when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date) is super frustrating. The buttons are impossible. I've had it with mine and will buy another product

The watch is quite lightweight and comes with good features.  However, I think it is very hard to use.  You have to hit the buttons just right and for the certain amount of times to change anything.  If you lose the directions, you will never remember how to change it.  It took me over 6 months to change it.  I had many people try to alter it, but it was to no prevail.  Additionally, the watch is not very water resistant.  I went swimming a couple of times and now I hardly see the time due to the water.  

I would recommend paying more for a lot better watch.  For this was a waste of money!

This product is not worth the price by itself.  It's fair at buy-1-get-4-free.  The time function works fine.  The compass, on the other hand, is virtually useless.  Having gotten 5 watches, all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions

i've had three of these watches, but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on.  its ridiculus b/c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore Triathlons.  however the interval counter is a great feature.  but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two

This is not a rosary. It is just a necklace with a crucifix and medal attached. A Catholic rosary has 5 decades ( 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys) this has no spaces to designate the Our Father from the Hail Marys. It also has 17 extra beads on the rope, and 3 extra beads  on the beginning
just after the crucifix

I've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped, so the crown no longer locks in place. I've tried contacting Citizen for waranty and they say it's not covered. Citizen claims that I over tightened it or cross-threaded it while screwing down, so it will cost $50-100 to repair. 

TOTAL JOKE! I'll never purchase a Citizen watch again. I've always thought they were cheap to begin with. This just confirms my thoughts

I really liked the watch as it looked in the picture. But, when I purchased it, I realized that its way too shiny. If you have a thin wrist, then the watch looks really bulky. Besides, the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north. So, you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time...

I am going to return this watch..

When I received these earrings, I was delighted.  They were just what I wanted.  However, after wearing them for a few weeks, one of them had a major discoloration on the back portion.  It was not normal tarnish, which one might expect from sterling.  Additionally, I was experiencing extreme irritation, which might suggest that they are not as "sterling" as stated.

With much disappointment, I ended up throwing them away.

This watch is very attractive. However, the clasp is not stable and it has fallen off my arm several times. I rarely wear it as a result and am always surprised it's still there when I do. With a more stable clasp, this would be a 4-Star watch -- but this problem is severe enough that it makes the watch worthless to me (hence, 1 star)

I loved the watch when I first received it.  I wore it two or three times, then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up.  I tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so I stopped wearing it.

Ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what I received was worse than expected in part because Amazon sent the wrong item. Spoke with Customer Service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first; however, the same WRONG item was again sent. The problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket, one even cheesier than the product listed. I contacted Customer Service regarding the replacement; they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct ... eventually. Both lockets have been returned; there didn't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket. I wound-up ordering a completely different design from another vendor

I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes.

The instructions that you do get are wrong.  The items I get and the ones listed are totally different.  It doesn't tell you how to use each of the tools.  Some of the tools I'm still puzzled in what to do with it.  The soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet doesn't look too soft too me!

The kit is a batch of tools that are mostly not defined, with little to no instruction.  Most pieces are of junk quality and break after one or two uses if they last that long.  

Clearly not worth the price.

I've bought a LOT from Amazon over the years. This was the first watch though. I've bought and owned several SEIKO watches. This is probably the WORST experience that I've ever had with Amazon and Seiko too!

The watch came with a box that looked water damaged. The watch itself has a broken clasp. It looks beautiful,but I bought it as a gift. 

When she opened it, the clasp refused to lock. Its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on. Amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures. How long does she have to wait for her Birthday gift? The warranty process could take weeks

I bought this watch because of the stylish looks, the reported reliability, and the fact that it was a watch that would never need batteries.  There were also other functions advertised that appealed to me.  I have owned Casios before and they took extreme wear while still maitaining their function.  This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch!  It has become very unpredictable.  Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments.  But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about.  I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase

I order from Amazon frequently, and am consistently happy with the products and service.  However, I was very disappointed in this item--perhaps my own fault for failing to notice that no dimensions were given in the item description.  I wrongly assumed that the charm would be approximately the size of my thumbnail, and was surprised when it arrived and I could barely find it in the tiny blue velvet bag that contained it.  It is miniscule--1 cm long x 1/2 cm wide!  The enamel is applied unevenly, and though the charm is tiny, it is evident that the enamel is thicker in some places, and contains air bubbles in others.  It might be cute on a charm bracelet with a purse or shopping theme, but would not work as a pendant, as I had intended.  I'm sending it back for a refund

I am rather picky, but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage, but also the name.  They were not what I was expecting when they arrived.  They are okay, but not nearly what I thought they would be.  They are not very sea opal-ish -- they look too glassy and transparent.  The silver is also okay, but could be better.  I would not recommend.

This set of earrings was only $10 and the delivery from Silver Insanity was fast, but false advertising really pisses me off.  They do not look nearly as nice as the picture, and in fact the "glass" part of the earring is plastic...and it even has bubbles in it. It's ugly. The other earrings that I bought from them also do not look much like their photos

Not as they appear!, March 8, 2007
Reviewer: Rappster (Denver, CO) - See all my reviews 
I ordered these earrings on a 'Gold Box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive. They were SUCH a disappointment, I returned them the next day. I did not expect the diamonds to be huge, based on their cttw, but the earrings themselves are miniscule! They look like they were made for children. I tried on one earring and couldn't even SEE the earring in my ear, much less tell there were any diamonds--it looked like I didn't even have an earring on!

I paid over $150 for this watch a couple of years ago, and I loved it when I first bought it (as do many of the other reviewers on this page). However, it took about 18 months for the band to break, and then less than 2 years for the watch to completely die. The solar charger slowly quit working - at first I just couldn't set the hands on the watch because it was stuck in "recover" mode, but the digital display was still correct so it was still somewhat usable. Then after a few months of this, everything went blank. I sent it off to Casio expecting a quick, inexpensive repair (or even a free repair, as I expected them to stand behind their product). Shortly thereafter, I received a repair estimate for $94.11 - more than the watch currently sells for brand new! So...in my opinion, the watch is probably worth the $69.00 that it currently sells for, but don't expect it to last more than a year or two. I won't be buying another Casio

I just received this locket, which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x-mas, and had to decline on giving it to her.  when i received it, i actually thought Amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in.  I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it.
sorry

I had a very similar watch from pulsar that I bought in 1991 - that watch lasted over 15 years with no problems. the LCD stopped working so I finally broke down and bought a new watch. I was shocked and disappointed with amazon sending me 3 dead watches - esp after talking to them asbout making sure it just works before sending it. the final watch was the exact same watch I returned for NOT working.

This watch died (battery?) one year after I bought it.  I like the watch, it  fits well and I'm able to swim in the pool and ocean with it.  But I can't find a place to repair it here on Maui.  It has a 3 year warranty but I'd have to mail it in.  After the battery is changed it needs to be pressure tested.  What a hassle..

I had a watch like this from Pulsar years ago and it worked well. This one I am returning to Amazon because it can't keep time and the calender keeps resetting to Jan 1. It was made in China so what can I expect. I am deeply disappointed in this product. No more Pulsars for m

I bought a Nike Triax C5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago. The strap is already falling apart near the bezel. The watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal, even if the problem is poor workmanship.

I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service (communication and such) have been very good.

I purchased this bracelet a few months ago and (a few days ago) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer. I was taking it off and it snapped in the middle.   Once you could see the insides, it was obviously not pure Sterling Silver as the "materials" portion indicates.  I will be returning this item for a new one (already gave my girl a matching one) and may not even wear it at all...

*very disappointing

Although this product is pretty to look at, one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands. I do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe

The good news is the watch's case is quite nice. Now the could-be-improved points. It's sized weird. It's a lot larger than you think. Add to that it's bracelet is rather small so now that I removed a single link I can barely get it over my average sized wrist, and once it's on it's still too loose. Weird , but true. Frankly it's good looking, but I don't think I'll get another one.

I ordered a Swarovsky crystal pendant which I thought was clear like one I had purchased once on a visit to a Swarovsky factory.  The one I received is clear but not like the first one.  It is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one. I was disappointed.

Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. Same thing in on other sites for like $1.  Speedy delivery was the only positive

The pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design.  It does not go with the center design.  I think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look.  Pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either.

I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one.  The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one.  The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week.  I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour.  I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear.  I returned it in disappointment

I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star

I chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo.  They felt quite flimsy when I got them.  I do like a lightweight earring, but not a flimsy one.  The studs on these are not attached as firmly as I would like.  One has already come off.  They are however very pretty.  The quality was just not what I expected

Actual picture of band shows how replacemnt band fails to follow curve of watch body. Real Dud.
Monthly cost of ownership makes it as costly as a Role

I recived the watch and it is fine, however I want to complain above Amazon's way to pack purchases, Amazon pack a tiny watch box in a huge box, then I have to pay lots of money paying a mail forwarder because to  this policy.

I use a Mail forwarder from Miami to Caracas (Venezuela) and I Spread 19$ instead 5$ because box size and I recived a huge box full of air bags.

This situation is not the first time to happend and I hope Amazon compense me in any way

The watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice, unique design. Unfortunately I have had terrible issues with the pins between the links. There are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and I have to shimmy them back in all day long. I tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it didn't last. This is the kind of issue I would expect from an inferior watch, perhaps one well under 100 bucks.

To be honest... when i saw the picture in the description area, it looks like an awesome watch!, but when i opened the package I wanted to return it.

If you see the picture you can appreciate the digital information, like thermometer, digital hour, day, month, etc... but in the real life, you must incline it until you are able to see it..

The other thing, is the thermometer, is not so accurate because your body heat affects it. When my digital home thermometer marks 72 F, the watch marks 92 F so if you want an accurate measure you need to take it off, and wait between 20min and 30min to reach an accurate measure (This information was extracted from the Manual). 

So in conclusion, if you want a watch with a thermometer built-in... just keep looking for other models.

This is a beautiful watch, but just a word of warning - it is BIG!  I actually returned it for a smaller one.  The watch face is 30mm, which is quite a bit larger than most women's watches.  The face was almost the size of my husband's watch.  If you like big watches, then you will love this one, it is beautiful, but if you want a normal size watch, I would reccommend that you keep on shopping

Though the design is cool, the quality of this earrings set is poor.  They are so light and the color is strikingly white, which makes them appear cheaper.  I also bought the pendant with the same design and I'm so disappointed with both.  :-(

I suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design.

I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed

I liked these earrings when I got them.  They were smaller than I hoped but would wear them anyway.  I lost one earring the first time I wore IT!!!!! I am so bummed! So if you get them put a back on the wire part of the earring

THE CLOSURE FOR THE EARINGS WAS NOT SECURE, AS A RESULT, EVERYTIME ANYTHING BRUSHED AGAINST YOUR EAR THE CLOSURE CAME UNDONE AND, WITHIN TWO WEEKS, I LOST ONE EARING.

THIS TYPE OF CLOSURE IS NOT PRACTICLE FOR ANYONE WHO IS REMOTELY ACTIVE

I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running.  Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA

I think the picture is better than the real thing.   The gems are actually pretty decent.   They are a good size and have a hint of color.   However, the setting is so deep and so bulky that when the earrings are on, you can't see the sparkle of the stones.   If the setting was daintier and the stones had more color, these would look great.   But as they are, the earrings look like blobs, not tanzanite.

I have had this watch for about 4 months. If you don't have a job operating a jack hammer it will probably run itself down. I am very disappointed in the watch. It was not cheap. I paid about $200. for it and I expected better. I am one of those people that never take my watch off and it still winds down and stops. I made a big deal about this watch with my wife, and now I get a lot of grief when I complain about it. It is sturdy, having hit the wall several times

The description states that it holds large watches. But they hit the glass when the top is closed, especially Casio's larger G-Shocks. The lock did not work, but I don't care about that. The beige material on the inside and pillows peels off! I will not purchase another case of this brand.

This watch was of such poor quality that the second hand fell off by the third day of use. The cost of shipping to claim a defect under warranty was more than the initial cost of the watch. A total disappointment and waste of time and money, don't buy this watch.
