Sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more. I havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time. You cannot return these or any food items to Amazon.
The Coconut was moist and tender, yet no good flavor. Taste, smells of cheap food grade oil.The Spirulina is too try and chalky, too much dried Spirulina in one bar.Again bad taste no good alive flavor.

I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why.

Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair?
It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess.
Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make "mechanically separated" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste "good"? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100!

My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..p

Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky

I had bought instant miso soup in the past and the taste was very similar with what you get at your usual sushi restaurant... so I ordered this one and... I shouldn't have ordered without trying because the taste is very strange... not pleasant... now we're stuck with 12x4 of something we don't like... hopefully someone else can avoid our mistake..

Scant vegetables and beef. Surprisingly little barley. Gloppy texture. Much too salty. Does not taste fresh. Needed addition of fresh vegetables to be edible. Hard to believe, but Campbell's is better

I really enjoy organic foods, so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially Newman's Own, a brand I've liked in the past.  I have to agree with the other poster, the flavor is bland and almost flavorless.  There are other brands of organic popcorn that I've found more recently that are far better.  Don't waste your money on so many of them!!

I ordered a 12-pack of this broth, and so far, I've received a total of 3 bottles: 1 original order, and 2 replacements.  Amazon still hasn't sent me the 12-pack, and now instead of correcting my order, they want to cancel it and refund my money.  I've been on and off of hold for over 20 minutes and they still haven't helped me.  I strongly recommend you find somewhere else to buy this product

I tried it also as a less expensive alternative, and won't be ordering again.  The flavor just tasted "off" to me.... kinda like old coffee that's been sitting in pot for a couple of hours.. didn't have that "freshly brewed taste"

A Million Little Pieces...an Unnecessary Portable Variation of the Old Pop-Tart

Call me a traditionalist, but I prefer the original, jam-filled Pop Tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top. As a child, I liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school. This portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset. The moment I ripped open the flimsy packaging, the Go-Tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor. Apparently the manufacturers at Kellogg's decided to use the same bread-like consistency they use for their standard Pop-Tarts on this bar. Especially with the shipping aspect introduced by Amazon, I think this is a mistake since I assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect.

On top of the bar is the same execrable, sprinkle-laden white frosting I avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago. Without the ability of toasting the bar, I find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar-rush. Consequently, I cannot agree with its description as a "ready-to-eat bar". One bar, a little over an ounce, is 140 calories, thirty of which are fat. Even though there are more fattening bars you could eat, it still has an excessive-sounding 140 mg of sodium. I only tried the "Frosted Strawberry" variation because it was part of a free promotional package I received from Amazon to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. I think I'll just stick with a granola bar if I get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy

Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it

I bought both the Ahi Tuna Jerky and Salmon Jerky. Both were dried out and brittle. Absolutely the worst.

Incredibly, the Salmon Jerky was worse (i.e., drier, harder) than the Ahi Tuna Jerky

Most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed. They put no expiration date on the bags so I don't even know if I was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way. On top of this, they were too spicy. My dog seemed to enjoy it though.

The Ahi tuna, on the other hand, was great

This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough, it is pretty much inedible.  And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it, it doesn't release much flavor, but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth.  I had the misfortune of ordering this, and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched, and I'm not sure what to do with them.  I even tried soaking the jerky, and tried boiling it with some macaroni, and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up!  What a waste of money.  Go for some beef jerky instead, and if you need salmon, eat it fresh or canned.  This product is a joke

Melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands, and I really like that each pod is individually wrapped.  I bought this because the Senseo Hazelnut was not in stock at the time.  Caution Senseo coffee maker users: The Melitta pod does not fit well in the Senseo pod holders.  The single pod holder is too small for the Melitta pod, and the double pod holder is too big for one Melitta pod, too small for two Melitta pods.  I found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side, but this may only be because I used it in a Senseo machine.

Maybe I'm daft, but I can't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine. I've tried tamping them, which doesn't work well and I've tried just placing them in the filter. In both cases I get watery dribble but no espresso.

As with other European products (think IKEA) there are no printed instructions in English, just line art drawings. Perhaps I'm just doing something wrong.

I like the concept of pods, but I'll stick to beans instead

I was very disappointed in the taste of this item.  Not at all what I expected from Splenda.  It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.  For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor.  Much too strong.  I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!

We've enjoyed these cookies for months as they were available for purchase at our local Costco Warehouse.  Just purchased them in bulk here at Amazon and were terribly disappointed to find that they arrived hard as rocks and stuck together.  They don't expire until July, 2007, so we're guessing that something happened to them in storage?  We opened several packages and they're all the same.

The reason I am even taking the time to write this review is to say that Amazon's online policy states that grocery and gourmet foods ARE NOT RETURNABLE.  Are you kidding?  I have a case of $30 cookies that are simply not fit for prime time snacking.  I've e-mailed customer service regarding my delivery.  It's doubtful I'll order grocery items again as I assumed the return policy for defective goods would be the same.  Just not worth the hassle.

Update:  Amazon shipped us a replacement order.  Unfortunately, again, all twelve packages are hard.  Each package has three rows of cookies, each row is stuck together and each cookie must be pried from the next.  Actually, it's a mute point doing this as the cookies are simply inedible as they are hard, hard, hard.  The date on the package is:  11 Jul 07 X, I suggest a problem exists with this batch, either from storage or from the manufacturer.

...who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange.  I love beef jerky, especially peppered and hot & spicy varieties. But this jerky lacks the chewy-ness that I expect in a quality beef jerky.  This stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy, grainy consistency.  The flavor isn't bad, but after reluctantly finishing the first bag, I can't bring myself to open the second one.  Perhaps I wasn't paying proper attention, but I was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in Brazil.  I would not have purchased it if I had known this

Although this is a good coffee, I was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino.  This coffee tastes nothing like it, it doesn't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests.  If you want regular coffee, then this is the coffee to buy, but if you're looking for cappuccino, save your money

I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..

I picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that Pirate's Booty was a great product. These tasted rather odd to me and I wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. Puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. It might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste, but that was not the case here

These coffee selections should be pulled off from your web site.  I know you guys can not refund my money on this order, but I am going to write to the products manufactorer and let them know how I feel about their coffee products.  The taste of the coffee makes you sick to your stomach. If I were you I would post this commit under your customer's reveiws to let other buyers beware of this terrible tasting coffee

I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware,  I am back to buying pods at the grocery store.

Be cautioned when ordering this product.

What happened was I ordered this product a month ago, and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version.  I called Amazon, explained my problem, they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement.

Well, the replacement came last week, and it was still the flatbread.  I'm not going to bother to call Amazon again because I know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again.

The flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy.  I think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor.  You can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top.  It tastes very different than wheat, and I like the taste of spelt quite a bit.

So please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order.  You may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call Amazon to straighten things out

These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields

I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas.  The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea.  Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received.

I had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee.  At first I thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee I use worked fine.  Sometimes it took 3-4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee.  Most of the time I would just give up.  Again, the other brand of coffee I use NEVER does this.

Not getting this coffee anymore - I would comment on the taste, but I never got to really taste it with the grounds and all.

I've tried this coffee with all size settings.  It is too weak for my taste even at the smallest brew size.  And if it was stronger I still don't think I would care for the flavor.  It just doesn't taste like good Colombian coffees that I've had, not even close.  This is definitely one I would not purchase again

I thought this product had reasonably good taste, but I have two major issues with it.

First, they describe this as a  Kettle Corn.  It is not Kettle Corn - not even close.  This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating.  Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet, slightly salty popcorn.

Second, each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it.  When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it?  They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier.  The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion.  Remember when a can of Coke had 1.5 servings in it?  The FDA made them change the label. If you eat the whole bag, you are eating 200 calories of popcorn.  No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies, so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name.

I won't buy this product again.  It's the same stuff you can get anywhere

After extensive research on grains and nutrition, our family added Amaranth to our staple diet. There's not a wide range of suppliers for Amaranth and we started purchasing Bob's Red Mill Amaranth. Well, to be honest, our experience with this product is that it's been of pretty poor quality. Out of 8 packages we've bought so far, we've had to return 3 to the outlet we purchased them from due to the amaranth being mouldy. And I mean "open the package and you can smell that it's off right away" mouldy. In addition, one of the packages didn't smell mouldy but after we'd cooked it and added it to the baby food we were making, the mouldy smell of the cooked amaranth was very noticeable. Not good, particularly as we're using the amaranth for making baby food for our toddler and mouldy grain is not really something you want to include in the ankle-biter's diet.

In addition, we found we have to hand pick stones, grit and dirt from each package very very carefully. Seems that they are included as a bonus. (Note that as the grain itself is very small, the stones, dirt and grit are very small too - but big enough to damage teeth if they slip  through the cleaning process - particularly toddler teeth). This cleaning and sorting process involves a lot of work, which we wouldn't mind so much if the amaranth was consistently good quality, but it hasn't been.

I have to say that while, after our research, we'd recommend inclusion of amaranth in anyone's diet, Bob's Red Mill Amaranth Grain is NOT a product we would recommend. If you have no choice but this, be very careful about cleaning it and hand picking stone, dirt & grit out before you use it, and make sure you check very carefully for evidence of mould both before and after cooking. In addition, I'd recommend checking with the retailer that they will refund you the purchase price if the product you bought is off. So far, we've been sucessful in getting our money refunded (when we had the receipt - we didn't once and we didn't get the money back that time, but that was the first time and after that we were poorer but wiser....

Great idea poorly executed with an extremely unappetizing presentation. This is from someone who makes flavored rice a few times a week. That being said, this is the worst review I have ever given anywhere, so bear with me.

You know how sometimes the rice sticks to the bottom of the pan if you overcook and you have to boil it out and it turns oddly clear but covered in carbon water? Yeah. Like that. The rice came out sticky (not it the palatable uniform Japanese steamed rice way) and was an almost alien kind of translucent brown that was nothing like the picture. Nothing. If you look closely, you might be able to tell it had once been rice.

Yes, I followed the instructions. 

My husband, who wanted to try having fresh rice at work, described it as an abomination, which was a relief to me because when it was cooking it stenched up the house with a horrifying yet familiar odor that when I put my finger on it smelled exactly, EXACTLY, like Onondaga Lake in Syracuse NY is the summer back when it was the most polluted lake in the world and people were warned never to eat the fish they caught (assuming there were any alive in there) and kids weren't allowed to wade in it. It smells like raw sewage, dead fish, rotting feathers and chicken soup.

It was 45F out and I opened the window.

Sometimes you buy a case of something and it turns out to be something you don't care for, maybe it has too much onion or whatever, but you know someone else will like it. Normally I donate these things to a needy family. I think in this case it would be cruel. I can't imagine anyone who has made rice on their own mistaking this for rice. Do yourself a favor and just drop a boullion cube in a pot with your stovetop rice. That's what they're trying to do here and failing at miserably.

I can't sell the rest on an auction site because I'm afraid that even if I am completely honest about the smell I will get a bad rating. The only thing I can think of to use them for is to smoke out people in the breakroom with the odor next April Fool's Day

I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids.  4% Iron and no other vitamins??  With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions, why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories?? It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST!! OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke!! I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN

First of all, the Tea Chest is disappointing to say the least. The chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like 'finish' which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic. 

The tea its self is alright, sadly nothing special. 

This item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered, all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after I opened it a few dozen times. Needles to say, this product way disappointing all around.

My sister worked at Starbucks, so I used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion.  I have a pump espresso machine, but only a cheap blade grinder, which should tell you that I'm only about mid-range on the coffee-snobbery scale.  That said, I prefer the starbucks espresso to this, in spite of the drastic difference in price when I buy it retail.  Again though, I'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much.  I only know what I like the taste of.  In fact, I only drink it in lattes.  4 shot lattes, but lattes none the less

I brought this tea thinking it was a great deal. Then while steeping my tea I noticed something in the bag. At first I thought it was a rock, but it looked like a garden snail. I cut the bag open and it was a garden snail! YUCK! I checked several bags and approx 50% of them had snails in them. 
This is the worst tea experience I've had

I was very disappointed in this product. I wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts, but they are too stale to use. They are NOT crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging. Unfortunately Amazon will not let me return them, so I'm out $20. I was going to try some other products by this brand, but now I will not

I tried this once. You can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery, popping it, pouring it into a bowl, and adding milk. This made me reluctant to try other Kashi products.

Frankly, I don't see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn.

PS. Amazon should add a zero star rating

I absolutely agree with the two other reviewers.  I had very high hopes too as I use McCann's Brown Bread mix ALL THE TIME - I don't think I could live without it, so I was very disappointed with the Fruit Scones Mix.  There is a very weird taste, to me it seems like 'soapy' or something, but definitely not a pleasure to eat.  I've got tons of bags left of this mix which I will have to throw away.  I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product, sorry

We are huge scone lovers and were absolutely disappointed with the taste of these scones.  The mix was easy enough to assemble and bake but the scones have a decidely odd smell and very caustic after-taste.  My husband, who will eat just about anything, threw the whole batch in the trash after trying his first one.  We had high hopes, but sadly, this product just didn't deliver

I bought about a million of these pods for my single serving senseo machine.  They don't fit.  One is too big for the single brewing well, and two are too big for the double.  Your only option is one pod in the double brewing well, and the coffee comes out very weak.  Just like this product

We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied.  Recently, they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines.  I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling.  At the time Melita made these changes, I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good.  Accordingly, I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars.  We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee

When I think "dark roast" I think full bodied and DARK.  Melitta pods are the worst I've tried.  I've tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre.  I did find the Target brand "Archer Farms" pods to be the BEST.  The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed.  Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods.  If you like a full bodied, rich, dark and strong cup of cofee, don't do Melitta.  I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine

"Highest quality, wholesome ingredients" my Aunt Ida.  Seriously.  HOW do companies get away with this nonsense??? The first ingredient is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar.  That the "Harmony" line would even consider masquerading as a "healthier foods" company and then try to pawn off this rubbish...  it's revolting.  I say don't buy from them just on principle.

I bought a case of these from Amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of "excellent" quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like Haribro.

Don't believe it. These are cheapo gummi bears, no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore/supermarket/bigbox sells. Pretty squishy (not very chewy), and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet. 

There's no point in buying these

OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon

While you could do a lot worse with other snacks, much of the health benefit of eating "fruit" in this product are outweighed by the chemical additives.  High Fructose Corn Syrup and Dextrose are in many, many grocery products, but they are not "Natural" as this manufacturer claims.  Both are chemicals manufactured in labs and are not easily digested by the body.  HFC as it is called, has been linked in high quantities to escalating the onset of diabetes.  

I have not tried this product, so I can't comment on the taste.  I would like to try a dried fruit product, one which is truly natural and not laden with chemical additives.

I had bought this before as a snack at the store and i love the combination of the beef and the white cheddar.  I figure i would try to buy it bulk instead of paying $2 a pack at the store.  However, I'm not sure if it was stored too long in the warehouse or if it was too hot in the warehouse, but the cheese was disgusting!  it was dry and crumbly and had this awful taste.  I even opened a second and third pack to see if it was a fluke, but all of the packages were like this.  The beef stick was good, however, if i had to order again, i'd order the product without the cheese.  It just was not fresh.  (and yes, i did check the expiration date and it wasn't expired

I was really disappointed with this item, especially as it's nutrition info is really amazing.  It's very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well.  It's also dark green, which isn't a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with.  

I am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available.

I had tried almost all the hemp protein products out there, and love eating the powder raw. But Nutiva's product does not taste good at all, compared to the other products it tastes like dirt, and its not milled to a fine powder, its very coarse so it will be crunchy if you decide to blend it with anything. The only thing going for this product is that it packs in more fiber than other brands. If your looking for a good tasting hemp protein go with Living Harvest, Manitoba Harvest or Ruth's Hemp Protein. I eat hemp religiously so trust me, take my advice and avoid this one. Bottoms Up! Hemp powder is the most complete source of protein out there, and easy to digest

Anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will HATE this! It's burnt, bitter, weak, battery-acid! And, as consequence, those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new Senseo -- but take heart! Many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill. I don't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for "senseo compatible pods" and you'll find several on the first page. Also, please note that while these may initially seem pricier, most third party pods work with JUST ONE to make an 8-ounce cup instead of the two pods that Senseo brand products demand. You do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe.

Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair

Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product.  However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita.  These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor.  Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired.  If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it.  If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it.  My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia

I purchased these the other day. I received them on the 11th of Jan 2007
I ordered some other ones before, 100ct box slim jims which were very good but unfortunately, they kept revising my order from Dec 19th until Jan 10th so, I canceled the order because it was taking way too long. I thought these would be just as good. ($15 dollars more than the 100ct box, But just as good & there's 180 of them, instead of 100).  WRONG!
These are really bad. They were all dried out & hard as rocks, and  to top it off, They expire on the 24th of Feb. Less then a month from now. I've never had this problem with Amazon before. Usually their stuff is fresh. You will not be able to return them either. Once they are opened you are stuck with them. I contacted Amazon about this problem & they gave me a little of my money back. I will not be buying these in the future. Amazon must have had these for quite some time for them to be so bad.

While I personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods, I have to say the $30 I spent on this case of cookies was a waster.  Neither of my children will eat them, nor will I.  They have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have.  Nature's Path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies.  Stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay.  The honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day

I was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews.  Starbucks is good, but I prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when I ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! One expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes.  I admit that Amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping, but geez, 2 years expired!!!  I'm hoping to find local San Diego area shoppe that carries pods so that I can try something different than starbucks

"No sweeteners" on the can, yet the first ingredient listed after carbonated water is "White grape juice concentrate", which might not be sucrose, but since when is that not sugar? Each small (8.4 oz) can has 170 calories and 41 carbs. I was so excited to find a healthy fun drink, but this is not it  

The flavor? A lot like Mountain Dew. Mostly sugar, yes there's some lemon in it, but it's hard to tell it's Meyer lemon as opposed to some other type. Another example of food manufacturers slipping a very unhealthy drink into the market as "100% juice, no preservatives, no sweeteners, all natural" -- Better they should say "drink this to make SURE you get fat and type 2 diabetes!!!

I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year.  However, I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning (I found the other flavors too mild).  So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors  (Sumatra, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil).  Sumatra and Columbia are the two that I liked.  I found the Kenya blend to be mild and sweet.  Even my wife, who previously used Hazelnut did not like it too much

I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like the droppings of crawly things. I must say I generally love Newman's products, and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt. With natural products, sometimes bugs get in them. That's part of the territory with organic matter. But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren't a part of the raisins in box after shrink-wrapped box. Some boxes were fine, and I ate the raisins in them, but the majority were tainted. I'll need to be assured there's been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman's snack-pack organic raisins again

I am sensitive to wheat Gluten and I swear this product has gluten. Everytime I eat a bowl of it I get sick. I bought tons of this Cereal because it does taste good but now I don't know what to do with it because I can't eat it. I think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel. Somehow it is getting contaminated. I wish I could send it back. It is too bad because it is a good product, it's just not gluten free

I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts ( in other words, healthful) but it's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces.  I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it's now in the rubbish.  I am truly very disappointed in this product.  It's description belies it's reality.  If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!!  It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating.  It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious.  All I can say is YUK!!!  I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you

I didn't like this at all.  I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love.  I just gave it away, cute little tin and all.  I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time.  This was certainly one of them.  I'm sure some of you will like like it, don't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds.  Mine said: "This tea is not a real peach, either.

I have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all.
However this Sweet Corn is all but Sweet.   I would say it should be called Salty Corn.
I think they would have a Great Product if they did away with the Salt also, or change the Name to Salty Corn.  Cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company-- I dont think they would give the other products a try from there line.   ** My 
Favorite is : Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend ..

I can hardly eat this for all of the salt, it leaves you thirsty it's so bad. The ingredients list reads, literally, "100% organic sweet corn, sea salt, and nothing else". They need to make it "100% organic sweet corn and nothing else", and they'd probably have something really great. As it is I'm stuck with 23 1/2 bags of salty corn that I'll have to give away

You just throw this in the microwave and it's ready in 60 seconds.  The drawback is that it is dry and essentially without much taste.  Also the consistency is very slightly rubbery

I beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested, and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan.  It baked flat & a disgusting rubbery texture, and was completely inedible.  When I very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund, the Customer Service person said they could not give me a refund, and said "thank you for your understanding" -- huh??  I'll never purchase any more of their products

I have been disappointed with this product.  We have always enjoyed Annie's products & have never had a problem, until now.  The "cheese" was so solidly clumped that I was unable to make a sauce without lumps.  I have used 3 different packages from my order & have had the problem with all of them.  I am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse.  Either way, beware

I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came.  I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however.  With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste.  Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it.

I really like the glass tea pot.  It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor.  Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste.

I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent.  On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint.

After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good.  Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is.

The bamboo box is quite charming

Flavored peanut butter was a short-lived and quirky product line from 30+ years ago.  It was a bad idea that was buoyed along for a few years by a cute name, a catchy jingle, a generation of sugar-addicted children, and adolescents with "the munchies."  Now, PB Max is trying this idea again.

As far as i can tell, there's no good use for, nor nutritional value to, this product.  It has a phony, overly-sweet flavor that doesn't taste like Snickers or peanut butter and is not good on any kind of bread unless you have really weird cravings.  Come on, would you take a real Snickers bar and make a sandwich out of it with peanut butter?  If so, you might find this product a convenient if inferior-tasting alternative.

This doesn't melt evenly so trying to use it as a sauce will prove frustrating.  It gets oily and separates and doesn't work well for dipping.  Yes, you could spread it on apple slices or eat it straight up if you are so inclined.  I'll go for a real Snickers bar or plain apple slices, thank you very much.  You could also get this for your kids to eat, but please try to be better parents than that!

Note that you are buying 6 jars of this at once, so even if you do find a niche use for it, you'll have quite a bit of it to use up.  I'm betting that you'll get tired of it long before it's gone

I bought these simply because I wanted an easy snack, and the reviews were pretty good. I took two bites and stopped. The second bite was because I really couldn't believe that I disliked something that much. 

The odor is pretty bad, too. These smell very medicinal, almost like a commercial disenfectant. Next time you're at a doctor's office try licking the counter, it's like that. Not that I've ever done that, but I can't describe it any other way.

Please try one of these locally if you can, I wouldn't suggest buying them if you can't.

I got this as a gift and as a person who appreciates fine teas, this is undrinkable. In fact, it's unsmellable. I opened the tin, and the smell was overpowering and clearly not natural. Smelled and tasted like handcream. Yes, I actually tasted it. Furthermore, the tea was practically a powder and the teabags were cheesy - the quality you'd find in a no-name tea from the dollar store. The tab simply said Ceylon tea. It looks like "Bentley" got stuck with a load of crappy teabag seconds, sprayed them with jasmine perfume and stuck them in a fancy tin. I gave it one star for the tin. If you have even the tiniest discrimination when it comes to tea, don't buy this one

This is the second batch I ordered. I have had to contact representatives at BrucePac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky. I have enjoyed the same World Kitchen Jerky from other vendors so I cannot understand why the order from Amazon has been such a disappointment.

I ordered Teriyaki, Original and Black pepper flavored ones.  The other two flovors are quite good but this one, teriyaki, is really sub-standard.  It has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others.

Ok,

I bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct.  This jerky is not very good.  In fact, I threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard.  Kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together.  Trust me when people say this : there is MUCH BETTER jerky out there.  I even e-mailed the company and told them that I was very unsasfied with thier jerky.  They offered me a refund and I should of taken it, but I decided not to

I've purchased this locally and it was delicious, so I was happy to see a deal offered by Amazon. Unfortunately, it never made it to my door. UPS reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to Amazon.  This seems to match what many other reviewers said.

first, quality tomato products should never be packed in plastic. The high acidity may cause the plastic to leech into the food.  Then, these are pooly packed by Amazon, 2 orders--both arrived cracked open as Amazon just throws them in a box, so they crack and make a nasty mess. 
As for the sauce, well it tastes fine, but i think it is not well balanced, very acidic, we feel horrible after eating it for hours. Simple good ingredients, so i'm not sure what it making us feel sick

but I may never know.  I ordered this item on October 27.  When a shipment finally arrived, there was only one container of this inside!  I ordered a four pack I'm sure.  So Amazon offered to try again sending the item, but it's now November 30th.  The item has been in stock the whole time so I'm not sure what has caused the delay.  I'm just thankful I ordered it just to try it out, and that I didn't actually need it by any certain date.

While the flavor is unique, three of the five packets of nuts were rancid! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had problems with the freshness of food products purchased from Amazon. 

Now, one to the two non-rancid packets. I got through one in a few days, and I was working on the other ... them I realized I had a major head-fog, you know, like a hangover, but without having had anything to drink. I gave up the nuts & it went away. For me, that's a tell-tale sign of additives in food. Not a good choice for someone with chemical sensitivities.  

I purchased this on a SD recommendation. But it was a complete & utter waste of money for me.

Got a deal on the machine, and love the concept.  But every senseo coffee I have tasted has been absolutely horrible.  I've tried 4 oz with one pod- way too bitter so 8 oz with 1 pod...still the most awful coffee I've ever had.  Normally I drink Gevalia, but I use Folgers sometimes or Millstone...
I don't think I could drink this stuff on a regular basis if someone paid me.  Of all the purchases I've made at Amazon, this has been the first time I've ever felt compelled to give feedback.  That in itself speaks volumes

I ordered the Chocolate & Mint variety. Amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly. However, I ordered the cookies in early November, and they arrived with a "Best When Used By" date of December 4, 2006. They will expire less than a month after they arrived!

I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault or not. The cookies are shipped in the manufacturer's Back to Nature box, so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on Amazon.com

Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand.  I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them.  That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence.  It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines.  I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk.  Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself.  I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem.  I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence!

I'm sorry to give this a poor review, but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it. I often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful. I can't speak for how well it works because I couldn't drink the whole cup even though I attempted to force myself. Yogi makes some good teas, but this I just couldn't stomach.

The sell by date on a package was less than a month.  So that they would not go bad, I felt like I needed to personally eat more than I would have.  I have a retail store and I need a bit more time on new products.  This was a costly mistake.  Also, the "wholesale price" from the business itself was the same as Amazon's price except Amazon gave free shipping AND a discount coupon worth ten bucks!  Cool deal beans Amazon!  As a retailer, I would think that I would be able to get a better deal from Betty Lou's or get a reasonable sell by date.  Very tasty and addicting

Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top.  The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating...!  Alone they were nearly tasteless and I'll never purchase again.  Yuck

I am a huge Special K fan. Especially Red Berry, but at heart I am a chocoholic. I was so excited to hear they had a chocolate version and I ran right out to try it. It is your average Special K flakes but with the addition of "Chocolate Pieces". The problem is they leave a horrible waxy coating in your mouth because of the poor quality chocolate. I am sure this is because it has to stay healthy but I would rather have a Fat Free Chocolate Jello 100 calorie pack then deal with the feeling it leaves in your mouth. So back to red berry for me

This is a STRONG blend.  When I want a cup of decaf, I usually want a milder blend.  And, after a cup or two of this blend, I still seem to get "jittery."  I question whether or not it is TRULY decaffeinated

Home and Beyond and True Value offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack. I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40. Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds. Are they trying to say one tiny pack of 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds??

The product is fine. But the description is misleading. Each package contains "40 count," that is, 40 filters. But this is not a "(Pack of 12)," as you would think from the description, from the price reduction (from $23.88 to $1.93), and from the shipping weight (4.20 lbs). It's just one box of 40 filters. And you'll pay, as I did, $11 for FedEx to bring you this one box.

Soon after I submitted this feedback, I was issued a partial refund of $7. Product description still needs correcting, but at least customer service was responsive

The oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this IS NOT an instant version of McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal, the oatmeal it is famous for.  I thought McCann's only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored.  I would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what I prefer and is much better for you

In Amazon's ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status. I ordered the Apple Cinnamon in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone. I'd avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards

I tried really hard to like this stuff. You know, organic and all that. The elbow macaroni is fine but the sauce is gummy, pasty and tastes like Cheez-Whiz. If you like Cheez-Whiz, you will love this mac & cheez. If not, pass it by. I'd have given it to Mikey but he doesn't live at our house anymore. My recommendation is to make your own from scratch. It's not that difficult and it's so much better.

There are bugs in the tea bags. Now, these aren't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies. These are the bugs that dig into expired produce. There are about 4-5 bugs in each bag. If you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed, this is the product to buy. Also, the tea bags aren't made from organdy. It's some sort of plastic/polyester. I burnt a bag and it melted, turned black, and glued onto itself. Horrible, unethical company

I've found Timothy's K-cups to be consistently good, better than the Green Mountain varieties I tried (I haven't found a Green Mountain that I like yet!) But Parisian Night is the first Timothy's offering that didn't impress me. I bought two boxes of it from Amazon and have tried using different brew strengths, but it always tastes bland. It's bold and strong as advertised, but plebeian. To someone who's just bought a Keurig and had this blend as their first cup, it might taste pretty good; but compared with all the other, better K-cup varieties that are available, this one is better off skipped. I think it's just a fancy name for a boring blend that has nothing distinctive about it at all. Their "Midnight" dark roast is definitely more tasty, and even better than that are their Columbian and Italian K-cups, which are very smooth. I think Timothy's has the best Columbian K-cups on the market. But Parisian Night, well...let's just say that everybody makes mistakes

Last time I order this sort of thing online.  I realize that 'raisins' was the first ingredient, but they weren't even *good* raisins, and the raisins outnumber everything else by a good margin.  It's basically raisin and banana with a few other things thrown in.  The coconut is an afterthought and completely tasteless.  The sunflower seeds settled to the bottom.  It's edible, but it doesn't taste especially good and 'tropical' is definitely misleading

Go to Trader Joe's for real natural peanut butter at $1.69 per pound. Yes, you'll need to stir it and that might seem strange at first if you have grown up like we all did on commercial junk. That junk that they add, which always contains heart clogging "partially hydrogenated oils" (read heart clogging) turns the nutritional value of your peanut butter to garbage. You might as just well eat a snickers bar if you're going to eat skippy or peter pan or jiffy or whatever.

Your local health food store may have a peanut butter grinder (and "butter stock" peanuts) which would be uber natural and fresh, doubly delicious AND cheaper.

From THE ADA (American Diabetes Association):

"Are some fats better than others?


Yes. Monounsaturated fats are the healthiest for your body. Nuts -- like almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, and peanuts -- and avocados contain this type of fat. Choose olive or canola oil for cooking. Polyunsaturated fat is the next healthiest fat. This is found in corn oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and mayonnaise. Use small amounts of foods that contain saturated fats like butter, lard and meat fat, bacon, and shortening. There are lower-fat versions of foods that contain saturated fats, like sour cream and cream cheese. A healthy diet includes less than 30% of calories from fat, with less than 10% of these from saturated fat.

This peanut butter tastes even worse than regular creamy Skippy.  A lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by "palm oil" they meant to write "socks".  Thoroughly disappointing, I only finished the one jar I bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and I wasn't about to waste it.  Buy the real all natural peanut butters or even the cheap store brand which contains Fully Hydrogenated oils which are fine for you unlike Partially Hydrogenated ones

Skippy pulls the worst kind of nonsense with this product - claiming it's all natural, which is technically true, but also implying that since it's natural, it's healthy, which is false for this product sice they ruined it.  Real peanut butter contains one ingredient: peanuts, and maybe a dash of salt.  Nothing else.  Real peanut butter is very good for you.  Skippy adds palm oil, a tropical oil which, while it's slightlybetter than soem other tropical oils, still contains saturated fats and is completely unnecessary, to this "spread".  Why?  So the poor widdle you doesn't have to spend a whole four seconds stirring it.  Of course, this would all be a lot more clear if amazon actually had the nutrtion labels available, but they don't - nor do they carry ANY kind of actual all-natural peanut butter.

Skip this, skip all the so-called "peanut butters" carreied here, and go to yoru local store to get soem real natural peanut butter.  Look at the label - if it has any other ingredient than peanuts and salt, put it back on the shelf.  Nothing else is necessary

This is not a natural peanut butter.  The listed ingredients are peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt.  Natural peanut butter, such as Smucker's and Whole Foods contain only peanuts and salt.  Palm oil is not a healty oil and is not recommended for cholesterol patients.

I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.

I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety, indigestion, etc. and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea.  Unfortunately, I can't handle the taste of this one.  It's just too strong - almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy.  I normally like ginger but this is too much

I've only been on a gluten free diet for four months, so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid.  The worst part is that Amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this.  I'd put it out for the squirrels but I'm not sure they'd eat it.  If you're expecting something that tastes anything like bread, you're in for a shock

I wanted to like this bar because it's high in protein and fiber, but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars (31g!). It's much too sweet. If they took away some of the sugar, it might be edible.

Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.  

Simply put it clumps.

The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement

"without any sulfites, preservatives, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors or flavors."

...but not without a great deal of sugar and high-fructose corn sweetener. Like the previous reviewer I bought these at Costco. Brought them back due to the sickly-sweet taste. There was so much added sugar it was getting a little difficult to taste the berries.

If you prefer berries au naturel or with just a little extra sweetness, watch the ingredient list on these. Sugar is the second ingredient by weight - and corn syrup is the fourth

The quality of this tea is not very good, especially compared to other superb teas by Two Leaves and a Bud. Mostly powder inside the bag, and has a very strong "grassy" smell and somewhat bitter aftertaste. 

On top of that it took 2 weeks for Amazon to deliver it.

I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..

I was so very disappointed with this cereal. It's taste is very sweet.

If you look at the ingredients, it's filled with sugar, corn syrup and and more sugar.  I counted 12 ingredients that were really just forms of sugar!  It is also loaded with salt.  I would give this ZERO stars if I could, because it has more sugar than most "sweet" cereals.  Why mislead the public into thinking they are making a healthy choice when all you are doing is serving sugar with a new label and adding a little bit of soy to the package?
  Absolutely ridiculous

As another viewer pointed out this product contains CORN SYRUP not at all organic. In fact the only organic thing in this product is the Fig. For those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you MUST read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate. This goes for all products not at all an attack against Paul Newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic

Contrary to the maker's claims, this product is not made with whole-grain flour. Instead, the first-listed ingredient is "organic unbleached wheat flour," an unhealthful, refined carbohydrate. The product is sweetened with common, refined cane sugar and corn syrup. All things considered, this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery-store fig newtons, except for the claim that it's "organic." Snacks like this could be made with healthful, nutritious ingredients; unfortunately, this one is not. I would not choose to buy it again. Instead of this junk snack, I would choose Barbara's Whole Wheat Fig Bars, which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices

I was very disappointed in the taste of this item.  Not at all what I expected from Splenda.  It is much too overpowering, strong and when added to your beverage, that is all you can taste.  For instance, if added to coffee, you will not detect ANY coffee flavor, only the Splenda flavor.  Much too strong.  I prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this Splenda product - without question!

I'm afraid I disagree with the other two reviews.  I thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like.  It does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly.  It's an OK substitute but there are much better gluten-free pastas out there.  Although the Glutino is cheaper, I personally like Orgran pasta 100 times better

The almonds are slightly seasoned with a 'barbecue' kind of flavoring, which is subtle but nice. The cashews, on the other hand, are hard to believe. The taste conjures up images for me of them being stored in semi-pervious containers in the paint-and-finishing room of my high school industrial arts class. They are REALLY awful, and any lover of cashews will be appalled

I wouldn't describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered. It's not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack. The best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein. Still, it had a fairly short shelf life for jerky; the unopened tubes had gone bad (mold? or something? ick) within about 3 months

I've tried this twice now, and both times it had an off taste.  A bit rancid, like it had been stored for too long at too high a temperature.

I'd guess that Amazon's transport or storage has a problem they need to work out

It's not the regular, strong Earl Grey Twinings I come to love.  This version lacks strength and flavor - two teabags are needed for regular strength tea.    It's even states on the box - Light Flavour Strenght (2 leaves out of five).  Beware!

The newly re-packaged Twinings Earl Grey tea (has the word "CLASSICS" on the package) is much, much weaker than the previous Twinings Earl Grey tea.  If you used and like to the old teas, then you won't like the new version.  I wonder if they have weakened the Britsh version of Twinings Earl Grey Tea

I love most Jack Links jerky products,however, I was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat - the flavor was lacking true pepper taste. It tasted like a bunch of powdered old HOT spices not a true fresh pepper cure. I think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using, as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste. I have not given up on Jack Links - just ordered their turkey jerky

I thought these would be slightly sour, like dried cherries I have enjoyed in the past. No--HFCS is High Fructose Corn Syrup--so these taste strangely sweet, like weird raisins. They are OK if I cook them in oatmeal or if I'm really hungry, but I wouldn't buy them again. If you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere

Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing.  It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors.  (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)     

Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had:  360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.    

Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie.

I purchased two of these packages in mid Jan 2007.  I have only finished one box (of four) and am finding about 1 out of 4 packets have caked.  Due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in (only my personal theory).  I just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem.  And they have known about it now for a long time, seems like they would have solved the problem....

5 Stars for the Stevia product...natural, delicious! 0 Stars for Amazon's inability to correctly store this item in their warehouses. I experienced the same trouble as other reviewers, packets showing up hard and useless. When purchased in the store, I have never had one hard or brittle packet. Don't bother purchasing from Amazon, instead head to your local Trader Joe's where you can purchase 100 packets for $5.99. Not the fiber supplement type, but doesn't clump and more per packet. Amazon really shouldn't even bother selling this product if the Stevia shows up ruined

I ordered enough Stevia packets to last me for 1 year. Most of the packets have the sugar hardened.  Every so often I am finding one that is powder as it should be. The others must have gotten some kind of moisture to them because they are hard.  I will never buy Stevia from the company I purchased from again.  I don't have the receipt or I would have returned them asking for a refund. I have been upset about the way they came.

I drink Lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant. When I saw this on Amazon, I assumed it would be great -- but it isn't. Even though this is sold as "drip grind coffee", the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker. The result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup. And decent is as good as it gets -- not great, not even very good -- just decent. 

Illy's (admittedly much more expensive) drip grind delivers a much nicer, smoother cup using 1/2 as much coffee -- so mabye it's not all that much more expensive in the long run.

I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches and 3.8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2.15 pounds.  In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale.  However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood.  In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest.  There are no hinges on the back.  I am very disappointed with this tea "chest" AND it's price

These are excellent graham crackers. We love 'em, and the kids do too, and it's not often that we agree. But you'll be sorry if you order graham crackers -- or any other food that can be damaged in shipping -- from Amazon.

Our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory, containing 12 boxes of New Morning Honey Grahams. That was it. No packing material. Nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us.

So we didn't get graham crackers. We got graham crumbs, and a few graham cracker fragments. 

By all means, order these crackers. Just don't order them from Amazon. Instead, find a retailer that knows how to do it right, or buy them from your local grocery. Unless you really want graham cracker crumbs..

I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor.  They were both disgusting.  The texture was similar to a protein bar.  The flavor of the chocolate one was very weak, contrary to the label, which states that it has a rich chocolate flavor.  The other one was very spicy, with no sweetness to cut the spice.  Not a pleasant experience.  I didn't finish either of them

This stuff tastes great but after doing some research, it's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy.  The first item on the list (which means that it is the highest mass ingredient) is partially hydrogenated oils.  If you have any problems with cholesterol, I suggest talking to your doctor.....  Or maybe you might want to be like many Americans and just increase your Lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers.  Godspeed

$17.00 For Dehydrated Dingleberries? I Don't Think So...

My wife bought these for me and I was just putting them on my morning Cheerios like a madman and I said, "Hey, these are good...where did you get 'em?" 

"Oh, from Amazon...can you believe they were only $17.00?"

Silence.

I just looked at her, "Are you nuckin' futs? Gimme those things. I'm going to put them into our safety deposit box with our bonds, our living trusts, and my favorite Hot Wheels..."

Blueberries are good for you and I would suggest to eat them on a regular basis, but the price for these things is simply absurd. Do I look like I'm wearing my shirt that says, "STUPID"? I don't think so. I'm sure you can get frozen blueberries for less and hey, fresh is always good, and if you can't get frozen or fresh, get a Hostess Blueberry Pie. Sure it's sugary and will feel like you've got a leadweight in your stomach after eating it but the pie is only .50 cents..these little blue suckers are $17.00. That's more than my whole wedding cost.

Just kidding. I'm not that cheap. Actually, I'm not cheap at all, but I do like money and I refuse to pay $17 for some humiliated looking berries...

Wish I would have paid attention to this one, the the previous review.  The cost for what you get is OUTRAGEOUS.  Only reason I gave it one star is because there was no place to give is ZERO starts.  Don't waste your money like I did!!!  FIND A MORE ECONOMICAL PRODUCT (plenty more choices on Amazon BTW)

The price for this and all other 100 calorie packs is for one box. This means you are paying almost two dollars per ounce. This is the most ridiculous sham I have ever encountered. The difference in price between this item on Amazon and this item in a grocery store is outrageous. (THIS COSTS OVER TEN DOLLARS MORE HERE THAN AT THE GROCERY STORE!!!!

Sorry guys, I don't know if I wasn't tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant, but the thing is I didn't like this one bit, and I still have lots of packages left! haha.. I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself

I had the exact same experience as "Heather" shown below. They sent me the less expensive NON-ORGANIC version of this product TWICE and then  informed me that they couldn't guarantee when the problem would be fixed. 

Remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide. Now add that freeze dried snacks are  concentrated. Finally, take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler's body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof. Do the math. 

Note to Amazon: This is a great product with fruit "and nothing else" in its ingredients. Please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids.

These things are just plain disgusting.
If you are ever in need of emegency rope, get these, but otherwise I doubt they are fit for human consumption.
It feels and tastes like eating soft plastic, and I would hate to think what they do to your insides.
I have battled to even give some of these away, so they ended up in the trash can, where they rightfully belong

I'm sorry, but WHAT on God's Green Earth are these people talking about when they say "the highest quality wholesome ingredients???"  The first ingredient listed is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar.  God.  I'm livid.  Corn is a subsidized crop in this country and corn syrup is a MAJOR culprit in the obesity epidemic.  Spare yourself.  Eat a damn piece of fruit.

Many Thanks,

This purchase was done by my husband.(Need I say more, ladies?) This soup(if you can even call it that) was a waste of money. There was hardly any seafood in it at all, and what little there was, it was in small pieces. It was more like 'cream in a can'. My son and husband are both big soup eaters, and love chowder. Let's just say that he bought a case of the stuff and 10 cans are still sitting in the pantry awaiting the next garbage day! I will admit that I didn't try it...it didn't smell or look appealing. But if my husband (the human garbage can) says it's awful stuff, I take his word for it....and so should you!

It almost seems like I received a different soup  based on the other 5 star reviews. The broth is thin, mostly cubed potatoes and very fishy smelling. Don't get me wrong, it was edible, but I won't be ordering another case of this flavor. I'm still waiting to receive the mushroom and blue cheese flavors

Edited Review:  My first order came with leaking jars.  Amazon replaced and the second order arrived in good condition.  The one star, which I can't seem to change, reflected that fact.  My updated review is three stars.

I was mildy disappointed in this topping.  Out of the jar, the black olives and the artichokes provide a flavor that has definate sour notes.  The texture of the ingrediants was pasty (as opposed to chunky).  I would have given this only two stars if this was supposed to be a pasta sauce.  However, I followed the directions on the jar to create their version of Bruschetta.  It is acceptable.  Since this is billed as a "topping" I am willing to give it three stars since in that capacity to performs at a pleasurable level.

The Vodka sauce is much more to my liking.

Although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll-----the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it (commonly called sushi vinegar)--------the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling-------I have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant---------the soy sauce is OK but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sush

If you really like Chinese food, you might like this chicken stew.  However, it was much too sweet tasting for my tastes.  

The main reason that I give it 2 stars is that it contains the artificial sweetner Splenda (see "sucralose" in the ingredients), but that is not advertised anywhere on the package besides the small print in the ingredient list.

I personally don't eat or drink products that contain artificial sweetners for various reasons, and had I known the product contained Splenda, I wouldn't have purchased it honestly.  It has the typical Splenda "after taste.

I too like the old smucker's filled strawberry better (aka fruit wheats), this is OK, but fruit filling is better. They probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china, thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff

It's not quite as bad as I expected, but the Strawberry Delight flavor of the Frosted Mini-Wheats suffer most from how it looks, the unnatural pink color dyed into the wheat biscuits in such a way as to make them wholly unappetizing. Otherwise, it offers a sweetened taste that barely reminds me of real strawberries, at least to the point where you wonder what the point is to this variation from Kellogg's. One 42-gram serving, a mini-box, equals a higher-than-average 140 calories but only five are from fat. The other good news is that there is no measurable sodium and cholesterol to the cereal. I would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would be preferable to this cereal, so I think I'll leave this as a pass

My product should have been delivered a month ago.  This is very bad buisness to think that you can ship something whenever you feel like it.  I am a paying customer that should have been reinbursed in some way for the mistake that your copany made.

I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is wonderful(!), but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards.

I was trying these as a change of pace from the Turkey Jerky I normally eat.  They taste ok (nothing special), but several of the medallions (in at least 3 bags so far) had 'crunchy' bits in them.  I suspect it was gristle, or possibly small bone fragments.  Not pleasant to eat.  

I may have just gotten a bad batch (other than the crunchy bits, I'd give these a 4 star rating)

Not only is the popcorn incredibly salty, but they do not taste very crispy.  Quite stale.  Overall, disappointing.  I sent my stuff overseas with delivery within 4 days after receiving them, so it is not that I kept them too long.  Too bad, they are too far to return.  Overall a disappointing experience

I first bought Chipotle flavor and love that one.  That is my favorite flavor.  The Gouda flavor is much too salty for my taste, so I will not buy this flavor again.  The quality of the popcorn and amount you get in this product is excellent.  I will be trying other flavors in future, just not this one

I bought this just to try something new.  I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good.  I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate.  I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey.  12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars?  It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way.  The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost.  But now I know, this drink is not for me.  If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you!

These are fine, if they weren't supposed to have blueberries. There are essentially none. Most pouches of the 24 don't even contain a piece of blueberry, when you do find one it's a very nice taste with the peanut, but sadly, that's very rare. 
Avoid this variety

It is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here.  I'm disappointed by that, as I paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews.

I'm old enough to remember "old time" licorice that was sold for 1 cent (even 5 for a penny) and that is the flavor and consistancy that I was looking forward to when I purchased this licorice.

I have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking, and I just tasted it to make sure that I didn't have my spices mixed up.  Based on that comparison; My verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise (NOT licorice).

I thought it was much too soft.  There was no "chew" to it.  It was mushy.  The only thing I can think to compare it with is a soft cheese, such as Havarti.  It is even softer than a mild chedder. 

Sorry... only 2 stars from me

The main ingredient should be SALT! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can. Come on, we usually sweat or need more salt in the Summer, but we tend to eat more soup in the Winter. My first impression was "boy this is salty". It would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper Cambell's cream of mushroom.

Although I like to consider myself open to 'cultural cuisine', I found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying about $6 for it at a international marketplace.  My significant other did the same.  I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty.  Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly.  I went online and read some other reviews...other people have had similar experiences.  I guess it's one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early.  Oh, those Dutch!! I love 'em (but hate this "candy")

I gave it one star for the concept.

I'm a fan of Dave's hot sauces. His combination of smoky barbeque flavors and straight heat always gets my saliva going. But this spray had disappointing heat. In fact, there's nearly none that I could even discern. It also had poor flavor. It tastes like bad watery vinegar. So why buy the stuff if it doesn't taste good or get your endorphins pumping??

The oleo-resin from the habaneros which are supposed to give the spray heat like to come out of solution and pool up at the top of the bottle. So instead of a homogeneous red color, you get a blood red color floating on top of a pale yellow color and you have to shake furiously to get the spray looking normal again. I called Dave's about it and they told me that's typical behavior!

I was excited about this sauce because I always wanted a way to evenly disperse sauce onto pizzas, but all I got were over-priced spray bottles filled with something I really can't describe as edible. I'd fill it with another sauce but it'd probably just clog the nozzle.

It's also intended for use as a natural pest repellant. Dave's suggest spritzing some on your garden to keep the rabbits at bay. I've never tried so I wouldn't know if it works as claimed. I hope it does or there'd be no need for this product to exist at all

I ordered both this and Honey Nut version.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version.  This version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals.  They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product.  However, the Honey Nut version is very good.  It has good crunch, but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it.  It's sweet, but not overly for granola, and no cinnamon taste at all.  I understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon, but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard.  The package is very convenient though.

I now have to mix in the regular version w/ this product to help me get rid of the Low Fat stuff.

Some label info:  Low Fat w/ Raisin (LF) has 180 calories per 1/2 cup while Honey Nut (HN) has only 20 more at 200.  There are 12 1/2 cup servings in the HN while the LF only has 10.  Product weight is HN 24 oz and LF 20.5 oz.  Finally sugars are HN 11g while the LF has 15g

I would LOVE to have the above item. Actually really wanted it so much that I called about it twice. BOTH times i was sent 6 oz. PACKAGES of pecans that I could have (but probably would not have) bought in any store. My husband is extremely fond of the CANNED pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line. I don't have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others. Sorry but i'll have to really research the product before i order again.

I thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which isn't very tasty.  I've made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch flour and they are a million times better.  Won't buy these again.  I expected these to be as close to the real thing as the Glutino crackers are to regular crackers(not the tomato basil but the plain ones) but they weren't

These apples are coated in sugar and other gunk (like sunflower oil) which gives them a strange taste. I was very disappointed when I tried them. I was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil, sugar and preservatives. Now I'm stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good. I also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse. I will not be trying any more Stoneridge Orchard products. BE AWARE!!, these products cannot be returned to Amazon so be sure before you order

Soft, chewy, a little grainy but a good flavor.  Mine were expired a week after I bought a whole 12 pack :(  

Don't expect whole berries.  Basically everything is ground together.  Odwalla bar is much better.  Definitely try the spirelina balls, though a little bit of a green flavor the energy/ginsing one is well worth the cost here- And NOT almost expired..

I purchased Diamond pecans in their shells in December '06 (note, not these, already shelled ones) and discovered AFTER the kids were eating them that they were all rancid.  Be sure and check the dates (if you can, there weren't any on the in-shell nuts) because there's not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying to make with rancid nuts.  I have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where I can smell and taste them

Perhaps it was just my microwave, or cooking it too long, but the two different types of this soup I have tried (Chicken with noodles, and chicken with rice) have both left a nasty metallic taste in my mouth that is very hard to get rid of.

I would have thrown it out, except it was the only thing I brought for lunch.  I do NOT recommend this soup

I do agree that the quality is nothing to sneeze at.  These fill me up, I know that they're pretty good for you, and I like the nutty essence too.  I guess that I really was disappointed in the taste, though.  The chocolate was slightly bitter-tasting, and took me by surprise.  I love the other flavors, but this one is my leat favorite.  I would recommend the almond butter balls before this one, they're soft and a little more on the sweet side

I eat pretty healthy and I'm always looking for new healthy snacks, especially sweet ones!! But this purchase was a real disappointment. The quality and quantity were fine, but the taste was totally lacking. If you've ever had "Dr. Fuhrman's Date Nut Pop'ems" this product is nothing like those. I would say the primary taste is "ground flax seed", not a bad taste, kind of mild, but certainly doesn't satisfy a sweet tooth

I was disappointed with this product. I love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste. They have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell. They are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil. Simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer. You should also know that this food product cannot be returned. I would have sent it back in a flash if I could have

OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon

I thought these Gummi Bears tasted funny, like there was perfume in them.  I have eaten other brands of Gummi Bears (or Gummi Bear wannabes), and these did not taste anything like those.  The flavors were not very distinct or fruity.  The texture was also very different and not very palatable.  I know that these are vegan Gummi Bears and do not contain gelatin, and I assume that is why the texture is so different.  However, I have eaten another brand (Sunny Bears) of gelatin-free "Gummi Bears", and their texture was very different, more like jelly candy.  I would buy the regular Gummi Bears, but I am allergic to dyes and I can't find any that are dye-free except these and the Sunny Bears.  

After I wrote to Amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that I could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them, they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item.  I was impressed

This type of machine just cannot make good espresso. Espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans, correct temperature of water, and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time. With a quick/no-fuss machine like the Tassimo, some of these ingredients are missing from this machine's process, so the espresso turns out rather sour. Adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it, but it's not a great latte either. Stick with regular coffee in the Tassimo, and although it's not wonderful either, it might get you through the morning

"contains 50 percent more caffeine than other gourmet coffees "

This is because it is not arabica beans, which are the beans of quality coffee brewing.  It is Rubusta, the cheap mostly vietnamese "filler" coffee mostly found ihn supermarket blends such as Folgers, Maxwell House, etc.  

The flavor of burnt twigs but you get more caffeine.  That's pretty much Robusta.

I guess it's ok since most people who go into starbucks ask for vanilla caramel almond suger drinks rather than caring about the coffee... or is it because they've never been told that there is big flavor a difference between arabica and robusta and they incorrectly believe that if they order without all of the suger flavoring they'd taste Folgers (Or Shock)?  

If you like coffee - good coffee - stick to arabicas.  If you like good coffee flavor and also lke more caffeine then just find a lighter roast of arabicas.

If all you want is caffeine you'll look smarter if you avoid the markeing silliness of Shock and buy NoDoze.

Two of the six packages were beginning to mold, but not even close to the expiration date.  One other package was visibly torn.  I was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air-tight, so I placed them in water. Five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal.  I imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude/pressure.  I cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as I did not eat them.  The silver lining: Amazon has GREAT customer service

Do not be fooled by this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry!  I have been a long time fan of the original Pop-Tart and the Go-Tart just seemed like the natural progression of things, so I went along with the newest technology in mass produced baked goods.  The Go-Tart offers you a Pop-Tart on the go, because everyone knows this is the 21st century and we are on the move.  I'm venturing to guess that Go-gurt was a success so why not make a Go-Tart?  Well, there are a number of reasons.  Actually just one.  You can already eat a Pop Tart on the go.
It's too bad the Go-Tart ruined everything I loved about the Pop-Tart.  The greatest hope I had for this flop of a product was that the frosting (or what you'd like to call that sugary stuff on the top) would reach the corners of the tart, unlike the original Pop-Tart.  Though the sugar covers the corners, there is barely any frosting at all on this tart!  It is but a thin line of the sugary goodness we would all expect from a normal Pop-Tart.  The filling has a gooey consistency, and worst of all, the breading part crumbled in my hand.  I had to eat my Go-Tart in pieces.  This is clearly not on the go.  This is worse than a Pop-tart, and is probably more fattening than one.  Save your money, boycott the Go-Tart

My own fault for not reading the ingredients - but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading. 
Basically, it's a $10 bag of blueberry candy. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient - oil and flavoring also added. I don't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it - I actually had to brush my teeth twice. This product should not be in the natural and organic category - don't waste your money

I love blueberries, both fresh and dried, but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste.  Dried fruit is always naturally sweet, added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy, instead of a naturally healthy snack.  Thumbs down for this one

I was excited to get these but  did not read the ingrediants before purchasing. Big mistake. To me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting.  I dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids.  The high fructose is insane and really  i feel they would be  better off with a fraction of what they add.

Beyond the glaring fact that most of their products aren't tomatoes, this one is a blight on the Just Tomatoes ethos.

"Just." But it has two ingredients. It's not "just" anything if it includes both bananas & strawberries. They don't call Cracker Jack "Just Peanuts, Popcorn, and High Fructose Corn Syrup."

Nor is it "just" something when it comes in a package of 2. They don't call a variety pack of cereal "Just Grains and High Fructose Corn Syrup."

The Just Tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it. It goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco. It's just not right

There is no doubt that this tea does it's job, but the smell of it is awful. I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains "delicious sasparilla". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it

First, let me say that Ahmad tea is great tea for the price.  This is not quite the same thing as great tea, but given the "price/performance" of Ahmad tea, I should rightly rate it four or even five stars.

So why only two stars?

Amazon claims you'll get the following six teas in each pack:  "Ceylon Orange Pekoe; English Breakfast; Earl Grey; Darjeeling; English No. 1; Jasmine Green"

But instead of Jasmine Green, I got English Afternoon tea.

What you might not realize is that Ahmad's English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 contain Bergamot.  This is a citrus oil used to make Earl Grey, which is also included.  

English Afternoon and English Tea No. 1 are both Earl Greys.  The bergamot might be slightly weaker than in a traditional Earl Grey, but it's still obviously there.  So half of this package is Earl Grey.

I don't really like Earl Grey tea.  

If you really like Earl Grey teas, you might enjoy this.  Otherwise stay far away

I've tried several brands of gluten-free pizza crusts, I bought the Ener-G as my latest product exploration.  Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit.  How wrong I was.  The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste.  You would think "thin" and "heavy" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say.  By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor.  I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first.  I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it.  It was an expensive lesson.  But, nonetheless, a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten-free products.  Here in the US, we are just starting to become familiar with how many people are affected by gluten

I couldn't taste any caramel or other flavor, just straight sugar. If you are considering this product and haven't tasted it before, I highly recommend you purchase a small bag first so you don't waste your money

The quality of this tea is far below that of other matcha's I have tried. The packaging alone is careless and does not bespeak of the tender care that is typically given to green tea, particularly the fine powder. I would not purchase this product again. The quantity that I do have, I will cut with other better tea rather than waste it. If you do try this product, use care opening the package, because the tea is inside without any barrier to keep it from spilling

I accidently picked these --- I really wanted the hot fries.  These just are not as good.  I guess if you like cheddar they are okay

I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..

These dried cherries are more like candy than dried fruit.  I was expecting a chewy, tart treat and got an instant sugar high instead.  I will use the rest of the cherries in salads or on cereal, but I won't buy them again

I was very disappointed when I received the dried cherries.  I did not realize that they included sugar and sunflower oil.  When I opened the package you could feel the oil on the cherries.  I had to rinse them in hot water before I could use them.  This information is not included anywhere in the description

In Amazon's ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status.  I ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain Splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone.  I'd avoid the Amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards

I thought this product had reasonably good taste, but I have two major issues with it.

First, they describe this as a  Kettle Corn.  It is not Kettle Corn - not even close.  This is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating.  Real Kettle Corn is a slightly sweet, slightly salty popcorn.

Second, each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it.  When was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it?  They purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier.  The whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion.  Remember when a can of Coke had 1.5 servings in it?  The FDA made them change the label. If you eat the whole bag, you are eating 200 calories of popcorn.  No better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies, so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name.

I won't buy this product again.  It's the same stuff you can get anywhere

I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy

Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.   Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.

I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is good, but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards

Why did they have to add coconut to these snack bars?  They would have been great without the coconut.  And now I find out I can't return them, and I'm stuck with them.  If you want them, let me know - I'll trade you for some decent granola bars

I ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar.
The cherries were gritty (dirty?, sand?) and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries.  Now I'm stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat

It is a quick meal when you need it, but hopefully you won't need it too often.  I guess you can't expect too much from a two-minute meal, but it would be nice if you could expect more than this.  It is an easy kosher meal when you don't have a kosher microwave
